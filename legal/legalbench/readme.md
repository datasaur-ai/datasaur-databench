# 📊 LegalBench Subset for Benchmarking

This folder contains a dataset that we modified from the original [LegalBench](https://github.com/HazyResearch/legalbench) project.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

- We selected **10 examples** from each of **129 tasks** in the LegalBench dataset.
- All selected tasks have licenses that allow reuse.
- We modified the format slightly to fit into our own benchmark system.

## ✅ Why This Dataset?

This version is useful if you want:
- A smaller, manageable version of LegalBench.
- A consistent format for testing multiple tasks.
- A dataset ready to use in benchmarking large language models (LLMs).

## 📦 License

We only included tasks that are clearly allowed for reuse under their license. For full details, see the original [LegalBench repository](https://github.com/HazyResearch/legalbench).
