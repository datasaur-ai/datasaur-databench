1 F.4th 12	We reject, too, the union's remaining scattershot arguments. The Board need not predict how its ruling would apply in other contexts or interact with other doctrines. E.g., Petitioner's Brief 23–25 (discussing unilateral changes). On the contrary: the Board “has reason to proceed with caution, developing its standards in a case-by-case manner ....” NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 294, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974). Nor does the Board's decision — which concerns only remedies — alter the basic duty to bargain. See Petitioner's Brief 23. Finally, the Board adequately addressed the risk that its rule would invite delay. See id. As the Board acknowledged, information “may be delayed” when a legitimate confidentiality interest is at stake. But in such cases, it explained, accommodative bargaining “best effectuates the policies of the Act ....” J.A. 153.	Conclusion	64
1 F.4th 65	Appellants invite us to decide several issues, including whether coram nobis or 28 U.S.C. § 1355 is a proper procedural vehicle for the relief requested, whether Honeycutt is retroactively applicable in these circumstances, and whether Honeycutt applies to the statutes under which appellants' forfeiture judgments arose. We decline to answer those questions because we conclude, as we did in Stephen's Honeycutt appeal, that even if we resolved those questions in favor of appellants, their claims fail. See Stephen's Honeycutt Appeal, 955 F.3d at 174.	Issue	247

1 F.4th 12	So the Board devised a new remedy. When a certification-testing employer raises a “specific confidentiality interest,” the Board will now listen. J.A. 152. If the interest is “legitimate on its face,” the Board will order accommodative bargaining instead of immediate production. Id. Applying that rule here, the Board found that Palace's claim passed muster, so it ordered Palace to bargain over the union's request. See J.A. 153–54.	Procedural History	50
1 F.4th 25	As the Eleventh Circuit has held, it is appropriate to presume that a district judge intended a sentencing package. Logically, this should be especially true when the judge imposed a below-guidelines sentence for the violent felony.	Analysis	127
1 F.4th 40	But the Fair Sentencing Act's reduced punishments applied only prospectively to defendants sentenced after the Act's effective date of August 3, 2010. Dorsey, 567 U.S. at 264, 132 S.Ct. 2321; White, 984 F.3d at 82. Defendants sentenced prior to that date remained subject to their original sentences.2	Rule	169
1 F.4th 75	Initially, courts limited the doctrine to “the traditional employer-employee relationship,” that is, to “a work created by an employee acting within the scope of employment.” Forward, 985 F.2d at 606. Later, however, courts extended the doctrine “to include commissioned works created by independent contractors.” Id. In these situations, courts would “treat[ ] the contractor as an employee and creat[e] a presumption of copyright ownership in the commissioning party at whose ‘instance and expense’ the work was done.” Id.; see also 1 Nimmer on Copyright § 5.03[B][1][a][i] (noting that, under the 1909 Act, “the courts expanded the definition of ‘employer’ to include a hiring party who had the right to control or supervise the artist's work”). In practice, this test often favors the hiring party. See Roger E. Schechter & John R. Thomas, Principles of Copyright Law § 5.2.1 (1st ed. 2010) (noting that, “[e]ven in situations very far removed from the typical employer-employee case,” the test “was often satisfied because the hiring party was the one who was the ‘motivating factor’ for the project and who had at least a theoretical ‘right to supervise’ the work”).

1 F.4th 75	Overall, we find no error, clear or otherwise, in the district court's determination that the game was made at Klamer's expense.6	Conclusion	273
1 F.4th 281	Because no evidence in the record supports the jury's finding that the School Board lacked actual notice or knowledge of the alleged sexual harassment, and because we find no alternative grounds for affirming the judgment below, we conclude that Doe is entitled to a new trial.16 Accordingly, we reverse the district court's denial of her Rule 59 motion and remand for a new trial consistent with the legal standard set forth in this opinion.

1 F.4th 75	Milton Bradley, meanwhile, began refining the prototype and made some design changes, often with input from Markham and Klamer. It ultimately published the game in early 1960. Milton Bradley applied to register copyrights in the game board and rules later that year, identifying itself as the author of both. Separately, Link Research applied for copyright registration of the game's box, and likewise identified Milton Bradley as the author. The game was a hit, and even today remains a money-maker for Hasbro, which acquired Milton Bradley (and rights to the game) in the 1980s.	Facts	259
