ViaSat Inc. is committed to ensuring that its supply chain represents its values and respect for human rights. To that end, our Guide to Business Conduct provides:

ViaSat’s supplier relationships are based on lawful, efficient and fair practices. We expect our suppliers to obey the laws that require them to treat workers fairly and provide a safe and healthy work environment. ViaSat will not knowingly use any supplier that uses forced, prison, or indentured labor. ViaSat will only work with suppliers who comply with all laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the countries in which the suppliers are doing business.

ViaSat implements this policy by obligating its suppliers to certify that they are compliant with these concepts. Further, ViaSat contractually obligates its suppliers to “not utilize forced, prison, or indentured labor, or subject workers to any form of compulsion or coercion” and to “comply with all laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the countries in which Seller is doing business.” ViaSat’s suppliers are obligated to flow these requirements to their suppliers as well.

Key personnel in ViaSat’s procurement department receive training on how to identify human trafficking and forced labor issues. Although ViaSat does not have a formal audit program, these personnel are trained to recognize health, safety, and labor red flags, including red flags relating to forced labor, and to report and investigate all suspicions of improper conduct.

Suppliers that fail to meet the contractual requirements set forth above are terminated. Employees who violate ViaSat’s Guide to Business Conduct are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment."

1. Flextronics Pledge Overview1



Flextronics Pledge’s four cornerstones – People, Environment, Ethics and Governance, and Community Partnership – form the foundation of Flextronics’ innovation and proactive solutions. “Beyond Responsibility, Building Community” summarizes the guiding principle behind Flextronics Pledge. In that, Flextronics goes beyond meeting responsibilities by looking at various ways to enhance its corporate citizenship and workplace performance in a sustainable way. Flextronics is committed to ensuring eco-friendly manufacturing processes, promoting inclusive growth for our people, encouraging sustainable communities, as well as bringing about economic-regeneration through close collaboration with our supply chains.

Through Flextronics Pledge, Flextronics continues to explore innovative ways of making positive differences within the communities we operate in. By integrating responsibility and transparency into our business, Flextronics aims to build positive relationships and trust with our stakeholders. Flextronics Pledge is the catalyst that helps us to achieve that goal and deliver sustainable impact on the global communities in which we live and work to become a trusted investment, employer and partner of choice.

Flextronics Pledge is also interwoven into the key values that drive Flextronics’ action. It embodies the spirit of our corporate commitment to build a sustainable framework for social, economic and environmental activities that are integral to and consistent with our purpose and values. Flextronics Pledge calls for us to identify our stakeholders’ perspectives and interests, create a timeline for action, and generate a process for reviewing and assuring outcomes.

Complementing Flextronics Pledge are risk management tools and robust systems that govern every aspect of our Corporate Sustainability program. The latter ensures that policies and directions are effectively and consistently embedded, implemented and monitored across Flextronics’ global facilities. The tools and systems are critical to Flextronics’ sustainability roadmap that is designed to mitigate risk while being proactive, offensive and strategic in nature. This systematic approach acts as our Corporate Sustainability compass, allowing us to respond to sustainability challenges towards positive social, economic and environmental transformation.

2. Labor and Human Rights, Human Trafficking and Slavery

At Flextronics we are committed to respecting the Labor and Human Rights of all our employees through the following principles which are clearly spelled out in our Flextronics Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (CoBCE).

				  Freely Chosen Employment. Our employees work in Flextronics at their own free will and are free to leave the Company upon reasonable notice under the terms of their labor contract. Our employment contracts are voluntary agreements and are free from forced, bonded, any form of slavery or involuntary imprisonment jobs. We will ensure that any risk of human trafficking is mitigated at our operations and at our supply chain. 

				  Prohibitions on child labor. We will comply with all appropriate local and international regulations on the restriction on the employment of child labor. 

				  Fair compensation, wages and benefits. We will ensure that the compensation and benefits for our employees comply or exceed the minimum legal requirements of the country where employees are employed. 

				  Respect for working hours and rest days. We will comply with local working hours requirements or the EICC guideline, whichever is lower. Overtime work is voluntary and employees are compensated for overtime work in accordance with local laws. 

				  Equal opportunity for all without discrimination. We will ensure our hiring, compensation, training, promotion, termination and retirement policies and practices do not discriminate on the basis of race, caste, national origin, religion, age, disability, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, union membership or political affiliation. 

				  Zero tolerance policies for harassment and abuse. We will not tolerate any physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse against employees, suppliers or vendors. 

				  Freedom of Engagement with Management. We will provide the means for employees to freely voice their concerns and opinions and to engage with management without fear of reprisals and retribution. We will respect employees' engagement rights in accordance with local laws. 

				  Health and Safety. We are committed to providing a healthy and safe working place for all. 

3. Corporate Sustainability Management System

The diagram to the left summarizes our PLAN_DO_CHECK_ACT management system for corporate sustainability. Specially, the process involves:

3.1 Creating Awareness

Gap Remediation



4. Compliance with Freely Chosen Employment (including Human Trafficking and Slavery) To date, we’ve audited all of our sites and all sites are found to be in compliance with our Freely Chosen Employment policy: “Our employees work in Flextronics at their own free will and are free to leave the Company upon reasonable notice under the terms of their labor contract. Our employment contracts are voluntary agreements and are free from forced, bonded, any form of slavery or involuntary imprisonment jobs. We will ensure that any risk of human trafficking is mitigated at our operations and at our supply chain.”

5. Flextronics Supplier Corporate Sustainability Program

The due diligence process for supply chain compliance is encapsulated in the four key areas shown in the diagram below:

				  The first, and most important area, focuses on “People”. Besides training our own people, we provide online training, via the Flextronics Supplier Information web site, for our suppliers on Flextronics’ processes and expectations before they undergo our Corporate Sustainability assessment program. 

				  The second key area highlights our stringent supply chain program conformance to the EICC Code of Conduct and our labor and human rights policy, including Freely Chosen Employment. 

				  The third column defines our physical auditing process that consists of two parts: a self-assessment (SAQ) to be completed by suppliers and a physical audit. As Flextronics works with thousands of suppliers, almost all of which are sourced and approved by our customers, it is impossible to physically audit all of them. As such, the decision on whether or not to audit, and the type and scope of audit, is based on several factors. These factors include Flextronics involvement in approving/qualifying the supplier, the level of trust we have with the supplier, and careful analysis of the SAQ. Audits are conducted by Flextronics employees and are generally announced. 

				  Finally, we complete the CSER risk validation through metrics management and identifying corrective actions carried out by the supplier. By early 2012, we intend to add key metrics to our integrated Supplier Rating System (SRS) to ensure CSER improvements within our global supply chain. 

 

 

5.1. Flextronics Supplier Code of Conduct Compliance Program

5.1.1. Compliance Process

Flextronics has integrated elements of the Flextronics Supplier Code of Conduct into the Supplier Qualification Process.

The Flextronics Supplier Qualification process covers several key aspects: Business, Quality Systems, Operations, Design, Product and Process Environmental Compliance, Supply Chain Security and Corporate Sustainability.

As illustrated in the pie chart, 37 per cent of questions asked in the audit revolve around Corporate Sustainability and “Product & Process Environmental Compliance”, demonstrating Flextronics’ commitment to supply chain Corporate Sustainability compliance.

 

Compliance Process

5.1.2. Due Diligence Process

A comprehensive due diligence process is used to identify high risk suppliers and high risk areas in the suppliers’ premises. It is also used to drive corrective actions in order to eliminate identified deficiencies. The due diligence process consists of supplier training on process expectations, a supplier self- assessment, a risk-based onsite audit to identify both critical and non- critical findings, and an integrated supplier corrective action process. Flextronics may conduct a follow-up onsite audit to verify the supplier’s correction action plan (CAP) implementation.

 



5.1.4. Compliance with Freely Chosen Employment (including Human Trafficking and Slavery)

To date, all the suppliers audited are in compliance with our Freely Chosen Employment policy: “Our employees work in Flextronics at their own free will and are free to leave the Company upon reasonable notice under the terms of their labor contract. Our employment contracts are voluntary agreements and are free from forced, bonded, any form of slavery or involuntary imprisonment jobs. We will ensure that any risk of human trafficking is mitigated at our operations and at our supply chain.”

5.1.3. Due Diligence Assessment

An independent audit team from the Global Procurement Organization is tasked to carry out Corporate Sustainability due diligence assessments of high risk suppliers.

Flextronics’ Corporate Sustainability Supplier Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) requires suppliers to answer 91 questions covering areas such as Labor, Ethics, Environment, Health, Production Processes, Material and Finished Goods Stores, Inspection Areas, Dormitories, Wash Rooms and Canteen. Audit results are evaluated and scored based on pre-defined criterion in order to eliminate any subjective findings. Each question asked during the self-assessment or on-site audit are assigned a 5-point grade scale, with 1 representing the lowest score and 5 as the best. 3 is the passing mark.

While we do not require suppliers to separately certify that materials incorporated into products comply with trafficking and forced labor laws, successfully passing Flextronics’ assessment and being qualified to provide products to Flextronics indicates that Flextronics sourced and approved suppliers comply with such regulations.

If suppliers are found to have any deficiencies, they will be requested to implement a CAP within a specified time frame. Our Global Procurement audit team will then monitor the CAP progress closely. Armed with a comprehensive evaluation system, we are able to generate statistics on the various audited attributes and rank suppliers based on their performance and CAP implementation."

The Walt Disney Company is committed to fostering safe, inclusive and respectful workplaces—in our parks and resorts, in our Disney-owned stores, in our distribution centers and offices, and in facilities around the world where Disney-branded products are made. In support of this commitment, Disney's Standards of Business Conduct for employees include an expectation of respect for all employees. In addition, Disney has established a Code of Conduct for Manufacturers and operates an International Labor Standards (ILS) Program designed to help address working conditions in facilities around the world where Disney-branded products are made. These facilities are not owned or operated by Disney and are instead mostly engaged by or associated with the independent vendors and licensees with whom we do business. As a condition of doing business with Disney, our licensees and vendors agree to observe the standards established by our ILS Program. In 2010, Disney also adopted a Human Rights Policy Statement. 

Prohibition of all forms of forced labor, including slavery and human trafficking, is a core principle of our Human Rights Policy Statement and is prohibited by our Code of Conduct for Manufacturers. Our Code includes specific provisions on Involuntary Labor that prohibit the use of forced or involuntary labor—whether prison, bonded, indentured or otherwise—in the production of Disney-branded products. Our Code also includes provisions on Coercion and Harassment that prohibit the use of corporal punishment, threats of violence or other forms of physical, sexual, psychological or verbal harassment or abuse against employees. We have been reporting on the extent of compliance with Involuntary Labor and other provisions of our Code each year since the publication of our first Corporate Citizenship Report in 2008. 

We expect all of our independent licensees, vendors and manufacturers to uphold the standards set forth in our Code and in our ILS Program and to implement any necessary corrective actions to ensure compliance. Our independent licensees and vendors agree, represent and/or warrant that they will comply with all applicable local and national laws and regulations concerning the manufacture of Disney-branded product, which would include compliance with laws regarding human trafficking and slavery. Disney also requires our independent licensees and vendors to disclose to us all the facilities that they intend to use to produce Disney-branded products, including any permitted subcontractors. In 2013, we had approximately 25,000 facilities in 100 countries that were permitted to produce Disney-branded products under our ILS Program requirements, and we maintain a dedicated facility database to store this information. 

The company routinely verifies labor conditions in the facilities in our supply chain. This includes assessments with respect to various forms of forced labor. These assessments are conducted by our global, dedicated ILS staff, by independent third parties engaged by Disney for this purpose and by or on behalf of our independent licensees and vendors. In our fiscal year 2012, we conducted and received approximately 6,500 social compliance audits, including unannounced audits. Our assessments evaluate compliance by interviewing workers and facility management, reviewing documents and inspecting the facilities, including dormitories where present. For any known violations of our Code, our independent licensees and vendors are required to take appropriate corrective action and failure to do so can result in removal of authorization to produce Disney-branded products. 

Also as part of our ILS Program, we provide training to our employees and management on our Code, ILS Program requirements and on internal processes and management systems to evaluate compliance. We enhance our internal knowledge by using data from external resources, such as the World Bank's Governance Indicators, to help us prioritize areas of highest risk for further evaluation. As needed, we consult with external experts and additional resources such as the U.S. Department of State's Human Rights and Trafficking in Persons Reports, the U.S. Department of Labor's Trade and Development Act Report and List of Goods Made with Forced and Child Labor, and the International Labor Organization. This helps us to be better informed and to direct our resources to those areas where the risk of non-compliance with our Code and ILS Program requirements may be greatest. In 2013, we worked with industry experts on the development of an expanded training and development program to increase awareness among staff and business partners of supply chain issues and risk mitigation. 

The Walt Disney Company is committed to working with our business partners and external stakeholders to find solutions to address working conditions and worker exploitation, including forced labor and human trafficking."
Yes	45	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 Information

In accordance with this State act, the following information is provided regarding our efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our direct supply chain. 

As part of the our supplier Code of Conduct, our suppliers certify that materials incorporated into our products comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

As part of regularly scheduled internal quality assurance audits, we ensure that suppliers have received and understand the Code of Conduct and we review the extent of controls they have in place to ensure compliance with company standards for human trafficking and slavery, but at this time we do not commission third party, independent, unannounced audits or verifications of our supply chain to evaluate and address the risk of human trafficking and slavery or to evaluate compliance with company standards for human trafficking and slavery.

We maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for our employees and contractors who fail to meet company standards regarding slavery and human trafficking.

We do not currently provide company employees and management with direct responsibility for supply chain management formal training on human trafficking and slavery as we believe mitigating associated risks is attained through our supplier guarantees and periodic quality assurance audits."

ResMed Inc. (and its subsidiaries, collectively “ResMed”) is dedicated to conducting business in a lawful and ethical manner. It is our expectation that our suppliers also conduct themselves in such a manner.

To this end, we issue to our suppliers ResMed’s Supplier Manual which, among other issues, sets out the requirements and expectations we have for our suppliers (and in turn their suppliers). We evaluate the risk of human trafficking and slavery in our own supply chain, rather than using a third party to do so, and include policies in our Supplier Manual to address those risks. Our anti-slavery and anti-trafficking policies include specific requirements and warranties for:-

		Prohibition of child labor based on the International Labor Organisation’s Minimum Age Convention, 1973; 

		Compliance with applicable local occupational health and safety and labor laws (including slave, prisoner or any other form of forced or involuntary labor); and 

		A right for ResMed to request a higher standard of compliance where we believe that the local laws are not in line with our corporate values.  The ResMed Supplier Manual includes an acknowledgement that the supplier must sign to indicate their responsibility for knowing and adhering to the standards of ResMed’s Supplier Manual and ResMed’s overall Supplier Management Process. Through this acknowledgement, our suppliers certify that the materials incorporated into ResMed’s products comply with local laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. Failure to comply with any part of the manual or the process can result in removal of the supplier from ResMed’s Approved Supplier List and termination of our relationship with them.  Specific training related to identifying and reporting human trafficking and slavery will be conducted for those employees and contractors linked to supply chain management. ResMed’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which is issued to all ResMed employees, clearly states the commitment of all ResMed employees to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations in the conduct of our business activities. This extends to laws regarding slavery or human trafficking in the countries in which we do business. Failure to comply with ResMed’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics can result in disciplinary action and or termination of employment.  ResMed will conduct audits of its suppliers to monitor the suppliers’ ongoing compliance with ResMed’s Supplier Manual. At this time, a formal audit will not be conducted unannounced by an independent third party, however, ResMed’s Internal Quality/Supplier Audit Department will implement announced audits during the normal course of business with the supplier. Those employees that will be trained to identify non-compliance will be expected to report any potential unlawful or unethical conduct within the supply chain.  ResMed’s Vice President of Global Supplier Alliance has overall responsibility for compliance with this Act."
Yes	241	"Forced Labor & Human Trafficking Policies



Super Micro Computer, Inc. (""Supermicro,"" ""we,"" or ""us"") prohibits the use of forced labor and human trafficking in all company operations as well as that of our supply chain. We believe that it is unacceptable for any person to be deprived of certain fundamental rights and privileges.



We are providing this information pursuant to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 to educate consumers on how we manage our supply chains, and, thereby, to improve the lives of victims of slavery and human trafficking.



Supermicro engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery by requiring that all suppliers to Supermicro sign a vendor compliance agreement whereby they agree to comply with certain standards of conduct. Among the compliance requirements is a strict prohibition of any use of forced labor or human trafficking in violation of applicable laws. Vendors must further assure us that they are in compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. The vendor compliance agreement must be in place before Supermicro accepts any product from the supplier and may only be signed by an authorized signatory of the supplier. This verification is conducted internally by Supermicro and not by a third party.



Supermicro intends to conduct random audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. These audits may or may not be announced and will be conducted by Supermicro, not an independent party.



Supermicro requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.



Supermicro does not currently maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. We are, however, at this time evaluating the proper standards and procedures to implement, if any.



Supermicro believes that it has established a culture of responsibility and ethical and moral behavior. However, Supermicro does not currently provide company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products. We are evaluating what formal training to implement.

Yes	168	"Nestlé USA, Inc., Nestlé Prepared Foods Company and Nestlé Dreyer’s Ice Cream Company support the goals of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 and strive to be examples of good human rights and labor practices throughout our business activities. The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles are at the basis of our company’s culture, which has developed over the span of 140 years. Since Henri Nestlé first developed his successful infant cereal “Farine Lactée”, we have built our business on the conviction that to have long-term success for our shareholders, we not only have to comply with all applicable legal requirements and ensure that all our activities are sustainable, but additionally we have to create significant value for society. 

Nestlé’s actions in this area include the following: 

1. Product Supply Chains / Suppliers 

In The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles, Nestlé commits to foster responsible practices in our supply chain. The Nestlé Supplier Code , which is accepted by our suppliers, helps to implement this commitment and establishes non-negotiable minimum standards for Nestlé suppliers in the areas of Health and Safety, Labor Standards, Business Integrity, and the Environment. 

Nestlé is also a member of Sedex (Supplier Ethical Data Exchange), a not for profit membership organization dedicated to driving improvements in responsible and ethical business practices in global supply chains. Sedex is currently being used by a number of leading retailers and brand manufacturers and over 15,000 sites are registered on Sedex. More information can be found at www.sedexglobal.com . 

Nestlé maintains a partnership with the Fair Labor Association (FLA), a non-profit multi-stakeholder initiative that works with major companies to improve working conditions in their supply chains. We invited the FLA to examine our cocoa supply from Côte d’Ivoire, the world’s largest exporter of cocoa, and their report was issued in June 2012. More information and Nestlé’s action plan in response to the report can be found at www.nestle.com . 

2. Supplier Audits 

Nestlé reserves the right to verify our Supplier’s compliance with the Nestlé Supplier Code. Nestlé confirms compliance with the Nestlé Supplier Code through either a combination of third party certifications or a Responsible Sourcing Audit conducted by a third party. 

In the event that Nestlé becomes aware of any actions or conditions not in compliance with the Nestlé Supplier Code, Nestlé reserves the right to demand corrective measures. Nestlé reserves the right to terminate an agreement with any supplier who does not comply with the Nestlé Supplier Code. 

3. Human Rights in our business activities 

As indicated in the Nestlé Corporate Business Principles, Nestlé fully supports the United Nations Global Compact’s (UNGC) guiding principles on human rights and labor, and aim to provide an example of good human rights’ and labor practices throughout our business activities. 

4. Code of Business Conduct 

Since the Company was founded, Nestlé’s business practices have been governed by integrity, honesty, fair dealing and full compliance with all applicable laws. Nestlé employees worldwide have upheld and lived this commitment in their every day responsibilities ever since, and Nestlé’s reputation remains one of the Company’s most important assets today. 

The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles prescribe certain values and principles which Nestlé has committed to worldwide. This Code of Business Conduct specifies and helps the continued implementation of the Nestlé Corporate Business Principles by establishing certain nonnegotiable minimum standards of behavior in key areas. 

5. Employee Training 

The new version of The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles was provided to each of our 280,000 employees globally by the end of 2010 and accompanied by learning and training tools. Employees were asked to acknowledge that they had received and read The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles. 

As of 2011, a modular training program was rolled out on the various components of the Nestlé Corporate Business Principles. The depth and focus of the trainings was established in accordance with the materiality for the different functions within the company. 

The Nestlé Corporate Business Principles will continue to evolve and adapt to a changing world. Our basic foundation is unchanged from the time of the origins of the company, and reflects the basic ideas of fairness, honesty, and a general concern for people."
No	307	"Costco Disclosure Regarding Human Trafficking and Anti-Slavery

Costco has a supplier Code of Conduct which prohibits human rights abuses in our supply chain. Practices such as human trafficking, physical abuse of workers, restricting workers' freedom of movement, confiscation of passports and worker documentation, unsafe work environments, failure to pay adequate wages, excessive and/or forced overtime, illegal child labor, and many other aspects of worker welfare are addressed by the Code. Our suppliers contractually agree to follow the Code and to ensure that their sub-suppliers also comply. We may acknowledge and accept a supplier's code as equivalent to our Code. 

To evaluate compliance, we arrange for the audit of facilities of selected suppliers, with an emphasis on suppliers of private label merchandise and when Costco Wholesale is the importer. Audits are performed by independent third-party auditors who specialize in social responsibility audits. While we retain the right to conduct unannounced audits, as a practical matter, some minimum amount of notice is given to comply with security concerns and to allow the supplier to collect records that are reviewed during the audit. 

If we discover a violation of our Code of Conduct, we respond in a manner commensurate with the nature and extent of the violation. ""Critical violations"" are considered serious enough to require immediate and decisive remedial action and may result in the termination of the business relationship. For less serious violations, we allow the supplier reasonable time to develop and implement a plan for remediation. In those instances we conduct follow-up audits to monitor progress. 

In general, we prefer working with the supplier to correct Code violations rather than immediately terminating the relationship. Termination is unlikely to correct the underlying issue and may cause further hardship to workers and their families who depend upon the employment. However, if the supplier fails to make satisfactory progress toward improvement, we will cease our business relationship with that supplier. 

Members of Costco's buying team who manage a supplier relationship will continue to be provided with in-person and online training. The training covers the Code of Conduct and its importance to our business and to the workers who produce the merchandise we sell. We encourage anyone who is aware of violations of the law or our Code to notify their management, our Code of Conduct Compliance team or utilize Costco’s whistleblower site: costco.ethicspoint.com."

Last Updated: December 12, 2011

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires manufacturers and retailers doing business in the State of California to disclose information regarding their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains. At LeapFrog, we are committed to:

a standard of excellence in every aspect of our business and in every corner of the world;

ethical and responsible conduct in all of our operations;

respect for the rights of all individuals; and

respect for the environment.

As part of this commitment, LeapFrog maintains and enforces written policies and procedures that strictly prohibit the use of slavery or human trafficking in its direct supply chain. We continue to update these policies and procedures as needed to ensure that we have appropriate safeguards against any mistreatment of persons involved in our direct supply chain. Currently, LeapFrog’s efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain include the following:

Supply Chain Verification

LeapFrog is an active member of The International Council of Toy Industries (ICTI), an association committed on behalf of its member companies to the operation of toy factories in a lawful, safe, and healthful manner. ICTI upholds the principles that no underage, forced, or prison labor should be employed; that no one is denied a job because of gender, ethnic origin, religion, affiliation or association, and that factories comply with laws protecting the environment. LeapFrog uses only manufacturers that have been certified by ICTI as compliant with its ICTI’s Code of Business Practices.

Supplier Audits

Prior to engaging a contract manufacturer, we examine every aspect of its business, including employee welfare and social responsibility. Having a “Seal of Compliance” from ICTI CARE (Caring, Awareness, Responsible, Ethical) Process audit is one of the key aspects being considered during supplier selection as it reflects supplier compliance with our standards for, among other things, trafficking and slavery in supply chains. “ICTI CARE Process” is a toy industry ethical manufacturing program aimed at ensuring safe and humane workplace environments for toy factory workers worldwide. These unannounced audits are conducted annually by an independent certified third party auditing agency.

Supplier Certification

We require all of our contract manufacturers to sign our Materials Sourcing and Manufacturing Agreement (MSMA) which prohibits the incorporation of materials in our product that do not comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the country in which they are doing business. The MSMA also requires our contract manufacturers to abide by LeapFrog’s Supplier Code of Conduct which prohibits the use of forced or involuntary labor and requires adherence to all applicable laws and regulations.

Internal Accountability Standards

Leapfrog’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires all employees to comply with all applicable laws, including those regarding slavery and trafficking. Employees who do not comply with the law or who violate the Code are subject to disciplinary action which includes termination of employment.

Training

LeapFrog trains employees responsible for supply chain management on certification of our suppliers, including compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which prohibits slavery and human trafficking. All employees receive training regarding our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which includes compliance with all applicable laws."
Yes	50	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act – In 2010, the state of California passed the Transparency in Supply Chains Act (the “Statute”). The Statute requires companies doing business in California to disclose their efforts to ensure slavery and human trafficking are not part of their supply chains. More specifically, the Statute requires companies disclose to what extent, if any, they address each of the five points below. 

Engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not conducted by a third party. Carter’s strictly prohibits the use of slavery and human trafficking in our product supply chain. Our Supplier Code of Conduct (the “Code”) specifically prohibits the use of “forced or involuntary labor of any kind in the supply chain, including any labor obtained though slavery or human trafficking.” Prior to engagement, a Carter’s employee or third-party agent evaluates each potential supplier on such supplier’s ability to meet Carter’s requirements, including compliance with the Code. 

2) Conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit. To ensure compliance with our Code, each audit of a Carter’s supplier is conducted by an independent third-party firm. The third-party auditor employs experts in local laws who speak the local languages. The frequency of audit for each facility varies based on various factors, including prior audit results and a risk assessment profile. Our goal, however, is to have each facility audited at least once per year. In 2011, our third-party auditor conducted more than 450 audits on Carter’s behalf. The third-party auditor conducts both announced and unannounced audits. We have found that providing a short notice period helps ensure that all required personnel and documentation can be made available. Unannounced audits, however, are conducted when previous audit results include serious or multiple violations of our Code. 

3) Requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business. Carter’s requires each of its suppliers to annually certify that it complies with Carter’s Code. In addition, each time a vendor enters into a purchase order with Carter’s, the vendor certifies compliance not only with our Code but also with all applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. 

4) Maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. Carter’s considers forced labor, slavery and human trafficking to be zero-tolerance violations to our Code. If any supplier is found to be non-compliant in these areas, immediate corrective action must be taken by the supplier. Regardless of corrective action taken, Carter’s reserves the right to terminate our business relationship with any supplier that does not comply with our Code. 

5) Provides company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chain of products. Carter’s, our agents and our independent, third-party auditors work directly with suppliers to train them on compliance with our Code. Internally, we are in the process of implementing a formal training process for our employees who have direct responsibility for the management of our supply chain. This training will educate them on the risks of human trafficking and slavery in the supply chain and what actions can be taken to mitigate these risks"
