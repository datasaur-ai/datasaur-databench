C‐TPAT COMPLIANCE

C‐TPAT is a voluntary joint partnership between the Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) service, and business (importers, factories, consolidators, customs brokers, carriers, etc.) created in response to the events of September 11, 2001. The goal of this partnership is to provide additional security for both the international supply chain and the U.S. border to ultimately prevent weapons of mass destruction from being stowed in containers destined for U.S. ports

Factories producing products for Whalen are required to comply with all requirements of C‐ TPAT.

.

WHALEN AUDIT PROCESS

Factories will undergo internal Whalen audits, or Whalen customer audits, generally at a time mutually agreed on between the auditing company and the Factory. An audit report will be generated by the auditing company within two weeks of the audit. This report will list any violations to the Whalen or Customer Code of Conduct standard.

The Whalen Global Compliance team will then work with the factory to create a Corrective Action Plan for all violations, and will work with the factory to define steps necessary to correct the violation; identify the individual responsible in the factory to resolve the violation, and to provide a target date when the violation will be resolved.

Yes	86	"Dell Slavery and Human Trafficking Policy Statement January 1, 2012

In 2010 the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) was passed and will go into effect January 1, 2012. This law requires large retailers and manufacturers doing business in the state of California and having annual gross worldwide sales of over $100 million dollars to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chain.

As a member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), we have shown our commitment to environmental and social responsibility. The EICC Code of Conduct establishes standards in treating workers with respect and dignity. Since 2004, the EICC Code of Conduct has prohibited the use of forced, bonded, and indentured labor and involuntary prison labor. Dell audits its suppliers to this code and takes seriously all forms of non-conformance. The EICC also has a Freely Chosen Employment (FCE) task force designed to help identify opportunities to share best practices among EICC members, expand the code of conduct, and make recommendations on available tools and training.

Dell has been participating in the C-TPAT (Customs – Trade Partnership Against Terrorism) voluntary government-business initiative since its inception over 10 year ago. Dell works with its internal partners (logistics, security) as well as its external partners (manufacturers, carriers, brokers) to secure its end to end international supply chain to guard against cargo tampering from terrorist elements. Dell annually re-certifies its program with Customs Border Protection (CBP) and every 3 years undergoes a more rigorous re-validation with an onsite review from CBP.

Dell has internal policies and practices that are based on the EICC Code of Conduct as well as international labor and human rights standards. This focus on slavery and human trafficking is part of a larger effort of supply chain transparency and accountability. Dell has taken multiple actions to verify the absence of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain, including the following:

• Slavery and Human Trafficking Avoidance policy • Supplier agreements: • Procurement professionals training • Internal Audits

• Shared Audits • Capability Building Programs • Worker Engagement • Stakeholder Engagements • Certify materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery • Maintain internal accountability standards • On site visits

For complete information concerning our supply chain responsibility programs and specific audit findings, please see www.dell.com/supplierresponsibility. This statement was not verified by a third party."
Yes	253	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act

        

Effective January 1, 2012, the state of California requires companies to disclose what they are doing to address human trafficking in their supply chains. Referred to as SB 657, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act seeks to “educate consumers on how to purchase goods produced by companies that responsibly manage their supply chains, and, thereby, to improve the lives of victims of slavery and human trafficking.”

Under no circumstance is it acceptable for child, forced or trafficked labor to be used in the production of any Quidel raw material, component or end product. We believe that no person should be subject to a situation where basic needs and fundamental rights are denied. The points outlined below in bold highlight each of the five pillars of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, followed by an explanation of what Quidel is doing to address each pillar.

		The company engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not conducted by a third party.  Quidel engages in verification of its raw material and component supply chain to evaluate and address risks of slavery and human trafficking. Preliminary risk assessments are performed by Quidel on potential suppliers with assessment questionnaires. Upon review of the questionnaire, as determined appropriate, Quidel may follow‐up with an in‐depth assessment conducted by either a Quidel supplier assessment team, or a third‐party auditing firm. Suppliers are periodically reviewed based on the risk as related to the potential for human trafficking and slavery. 

		The company conducts audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains. The disclosure shall specify if the verification was not an independent, unannounced audit. 

From time to time, Quidel conducts audits of direct material suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with Quidel’s standards for human trafficking and slavery. Direct material suppliers are evaluated through audits on their compliance with the terms of our supply agreement. Our audits may be announced our unannounced depending on the risk assessment for human trafficking at the supplier and any notice set forth in our supply agreements. The audits may be conducted by either a Quidel supplier assessment team, or a third‐party auditing firm. Following audits, suppliers are required to produce a corrective action plan to outline how the supplier will resolve any issues uncovered in the audits. Quidel has zero tolerance for human trafficking or slavery.

		The company requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business. 

		The company maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. 

		The company provides company employees and management, who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, training on human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products. 



Quidel’s purchase order and supply agreements require all direct material suppliers to comply with all applicable laws, including those regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country in which the suppliers are doing business.

Quidel maintains and enforces internal accountability standards and procedures for employees through our code of conduct regarding slavery and human trafficking. Our code of conduct emphasizes that employees who engage contractors are obligated to report any suspected human trafficking or slavery. In the case of non‐compliance or suspected non‐compliance, Quidel reserves the right to review the specific situation and develop a best possible strategy for resolution. If cases of non‐ compliance are not resolved within a timely manner, Quidel may terminate the business relationship.



Quidel conducts internal training on Quidel’s Code of Conduct to ensure the necessary participants in the supply chain management team are knowledgeable and aware of the issues and concerns surrounding, and mitigating risks to, the supply chain, including risks of human trafficking and slav"

Copies shall be supplied to individual employees at their request, and at least once annually, included with the employees’ regular pay.

Vendors/Suppliers must ensure that any parties supplying them with materials and/or labor in the manufacture of BJ’s Wholesale Club products also abide by the provisions of BJ’s Wholesale Club’s Code of Business Conduct. Although i’’s Wholesale Club’s Code of Business Conduct, in the event of any willful, non-compliance with these regulations, BJ’s Wholesale Club may terminate or refuse to renew supply agreements with a Vendor/Supplier.

Kingston sends our Supplier Code of Conduct and acknowledgment letters to direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

Kingston maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for employees and contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking.

Kingston employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management receive training on the elements of SB 657."
Yes	306	"Forced Labor and Human Trafficking

Our Human Rights Policy and Supplier Guiding Principles expressly prohibit the use of all forms of forced labor, including prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor, military labor, slave labor and human trafficking.

The Coca-Cola Company's Human Rights Policy applies to all of the entities that it owns, holds a majority interest in or for which we have management responsibility. Our Human Rights Policy is guided by international human rights principles, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. The policy provides a consistent approach to workplace rights worldwide and embeds it as an integral part of our culture, strategy and day-to-day operations. We conduct independent third party assessments of our operations to validate compliance to our Human Rights Policy. In the past year, we have trained thousands of Company associates on our Human Rights Policy. This training has now been incorporated as a standard training module for all employees.

Our Supplier Guiding Principles (SGP) communicate our values and expectations of suppliers and emphasize the importance of responsible workplace practices that respect human rights and comply, at a minimum, with applicable environmental and local labor laws and core international conventions. The Supplier Guiding Principles reflect our commitment to respect human rights across our business system and global supply chain.

These minimum requirements are a part of all agreements between The Coca-Cola Company and all of our direct and authorized suppliers that make up our global supply chain. We expect our suppliers to develop and implement appropriate internal business processes to ensure compliance with the Supplier Guiding Principles. The Company routinely verifies compliance by using independent third parties to assess suppliers' compliance with the SGP; the assessments generally include confidential interviews with employees and on-site contract workers. If a supplier fails to uphold any aspect of the SGP requirements, the supplier is expected to implement corrective actions. The Company reserves the right to conduct unannounced audits at is discretion and to terminate an agreement with any supplier that cannot demonstrate that it is upholding the SGP requirements. Company employees are required to report any violation of Company policy or law, including WRP and SGP. The Company maintains a third-party service to allow employees and vendors to report violations 24 hours a day. In all of our Purchase Orders, suppliers certify that all product supplied is in compliance with all applicable country laws and regulations, including those regarding forced labor, including human trafficking.

The Coca-Cola Company is a founding member of the Global Business Coalition Against Human Trafficking (gBCAT), a group of global corporations that recognize the critical role business can play in ending human trafficking and all forms of modern-day slavery.

The mission of gBCAT is to mobilize the expertise, resources and collective voice of its members to eliminate human trafficking and other forms of forced labor in supply chains. Other founding members include: ExxonMobil, Microsoft, Delta Air Lines, Carlson, ManpowerGroup, LexisNexis, NXP and Travelport.

The Coca-Cola Company expressly prohibits any form of human trafficking within our system or by any company that directly supplies or provides services to our business. We conduct more than 2,000 audits each year of our Company, franchise bottlers and supply chain to ensure compliance with our workplace and human rights policies, which include provisions prohibiting human trafficking.

In February 2012, we hosted a conference on human trafficking in labor sourcing, which was attended by more than 75 business leaders, human rights experts investors, NGOs, legal experts and others. The conference focused on exploring solutions to eliminate human trafficking in labor sourcing. 

In January 2013 in Atlanta, we sponsored a panel discussion on human trafficking that was moderated by former Atlanta mayor Shirley Franklin. In May 2013, in conjunction with our human rights conference, we hosted a one-day multi-stakeholder meeting on human trafficking sponsored by the Institute for Human Rights and Business and Humanity United to address two key contributors to human trafficking: holding of passports and payment of recruiting fees.

Recognizing that migrant workers are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and human trafficking, in 2014 we reviewed our policies and due diligence activities with the aim of better protecting such workers throughout our supply chain.   We publically committed to three principles related to the recruitment and employment of migrant workers: 

Employment terms are represented in a truthful, clear manner and in the language understood by workers prior to employment

Worker does not pay recruitment, placement or transportation fees (including transportation to and from host country)

Worker has access to personal identity documents (2 hours)

These principles, along with our strong overall prohibition of forced labor, align with the recent Executive Order 13627 and create a framework for responsible and transparent recruitment and employment practices."

Yes	50	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 

Bridgford Foods Corporation is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen, and to actively engaging and promoting socially responsible and ethical business practices. This commitment extends to our supply chain, and we work with our suppliers to ensure that together we manage our business and business relationships in a socially responsible and ethical way. 

Effective January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires Bridgford Foods to disclose our efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our supply chain. Bridgford combats human trafficking on two fronts: first, by holding our suppliers to a high standard of accountability; and second, by ensuring our own employees are made aware of the problem of human trafficking, and providing them with relevant training about the problem of human trafficking. Bridgford is committed to conducting its business in a lawful and ethical manner, and therefore expects both its suppliers and employees to comport themselves in the same manner. 

Bridgford has long required compliance with applicable labor and employment laws, including those that address the illegality of human trafficking and slavery. Now, we are taking steps to verify such compliance from our suppliers. To evaluate and address the risks of human trafficking and slavery specific to each link in our supply chain, and verify that our suppliers are combating human trafficking, Bridgford Foods utilizes a Supplier Code of Conduct, which prohibits all types of illegal conduct by our suppliers including unlawful discrimination and harassment as well as human trafficking and slavery.  The Code of Conduct makes clear Bridgford Foods’ commitment to eradicating human trafficking. Bridgford Foods requires each and every supplier to accept the Supplier Code of Conduct, and to sign an acknowledgement of receipt of the Code. 

To evaluate supplier compliance with our Supplier Code, particularly with the provisions that prohibit human trafficking and slavery, Bridgford Foods has obtained the authority to conduct unannounced audits of its suppliers to ensure their compliance with the Code of Conduct. If Bridgford ever receives a Complaint or other constructive knowledge of an allegation of human trafficking or slavery, it requires the supplier to perform a thorough and complete investigation and report the results of the investigation to Bridgford. Additionally, Bridgford Foods requires that suppliers certify that all materials incorporated into their products abide by applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. 

Moreover, Bridgford Foods has a corporate Human Rights Policy. This policy further advances our goal of remaining socially responsible, while at the same time maintaining an accountability standard to which we hold our employees. As our policy states, we have zero tolerance for human trafficking and slavery. This policy is distributed to, and applicable to, all employees. 

To make sure our employees have the requisite knowledge to aid in our efforts to eradicate human trafficking, Bridgford Foods makes available to all our employees various training and information addressing human rights, including the human trafficking training offered by the Department of Homeland Security. All employees are encouraged to avail themselves of these trainings and opportunities. 

Bridgford Foods is committed to working closely with its suppliers and others to raise awareness of and eradicate slavery and human trafficking. We remain vigilant on this issue, and, if necessary, will hold any offending supplier accountable for its violation of our policies and the law."
