Yes	86	"The purpose of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (S.B. 657) is to provide the public with information about a company’s efforts to address the global issue of human trafficking and slavery.

Del Monte Foods, Inc. is opposed to human trafficking and forced labor at any level. The following are steps we take to ensure that forced labor and human trafficking do not exist in our supply chain:

Supplier Assessments and Verification

Del Monte sourcing managers conduct multiple visits to contract manufacturer facilities prior to beginning a relationship with a contract manufacturer.

Supplier Certifications

Del Monte contract manufacturers are required to certify compliance with the Del Monte Supplier Code of Conduct, which prohibits suppliers from participating in, encouraging, aiding or fostering forced labor or human trafficking in any manner. The Supplier Code of Conduct and Purchase Order Terms and Conditions also require that suppliers comply with international, national and local laws, rules and regulations concerning labor, human rights and the environment.

Internal Accountability and Training

Del Monte employees who witness a violation of Del Monte policies and standards, including forced labor and human trafficking, are required to notify their direct supervisor, the Human Resources Department, the Law Department, or call the confidential Business Conduct Hotline. Furthermore, our Facility Security Policy has procedures in place that help to ensure the security of shipments from our suppliers, thus reducing the possibility of human trafficking opportunities.

Del Monte trains employees responsible for supply chain management, procurement, and internal auditing to identify and respond to qualitative and social responsibility issues in the supply chain.

Supplier Audits We conduct periodic audits of our contract manufacturers and certain other direct suppliers. These audits are conducted by our internal audit and/or supply chain teams which are trained in assessing risks in our supply chain. Independent, unannounced audits may be used to address quality assurance and compliance issues, but are not currently used to specifically audit compliance with human trafficking and slavery requirements. Del Monte’s Supplier Code of Conduct, Purchase Order Terms and Conditions, standard form Contract Manufacturing Agreement, and Procurement Purchasing Policy all prohibit forced labor and child labor. If an issue of human trafficking or slavery comes to our attention, then we would require that the supplier address the issue(s) or face termination of the supplier relationship."

Updated on April 30, 2015

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657) requires many companies, including SanDisk, to disclose on their websites the efforts they take to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains for goods offered for sale. SB 657 requires disclosures regarding verification, auditing, certification, internal accountability and training.

SanDisk’s core business philosophy is to conduct business under the principles of fairness, integrity and transparency. We strive to continuously improve our supply chain to support our Supplier Code of Conduct, Worldwide Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and corporate social responsibility efforts.

SanDisk has been a member of Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) since 2013. The EICC is comprised of leading electronics industry companies that have joined together to promote freely chosen employment, safe working conditions, ethical business practices, and environmental stewardship globally throughout the electronics industry supply chain. EICC members adhere to a common EICC Code of Conduct, which addresses supply chain performance expectations for labor, health and safety, environmental practices, ethics and management systems. SanDisk’s own Supplier Code of Conduct aligns with that of the EICC, and we, in turn, require similar commitments from our suppliers.

Verification

SanDisk provides manufacturing suppliers with a supplier survey, which, among other things, includes questions to help identify and assess risks of human trafficking and slavery in the supply chain. Survey responses are tracked, and upon SanDisk’s request, relevant documents, procedures and records are reviewed.

In addition, manufacturing suppliers receive and must acknowledge adherence to SanDisk’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which among other things, does not permit human trafficking and slavery by the supplier or in the supplier’s supply chain.

Auditing

SanDisk’s supplier supply chain audit program includes, among other things, evaluation of manufacturing suppliers’ compliance with respect to the prohibition of human trafficking and slavery set forth in the SanDisk Supplier Code of Conduct. The Supplier Code of Conduct is available on our website at http://www.sandisk.com/assets/umbraco/aboutsandisk/corporate-social- responsibility/sandisk_supplier_code_of_ethical_conduct.pdf. Non-conformance upon audit is recorded in our corrective and preventive action system and monitored for correction and closure.

The above mentioned audits are conducted either by SanDisk and/or an independent third party based on the human trafficking and slavery standards set forth in the SanDisk Supplier Code of Conduct. Audits are typically announced prior to being conducted.

Certification

Most SanDisk manufacturing suppliers certify by contract or in terms and conditions that the materials and services incorporated into SanDisk products are made or provided in compliance with the relevant laws, including laws against slavery or human trafficking, of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

Internal Accountability

SanDisk procurement and quality functions are responsible for administering the programs to ensure that manufacturing suppliers affirm compliance to the SanDisk Supplier Code of Conduct, including provisions regarding anti-trafficking and slavery.

In addition, SanDisk employees are required to annually acknowledge adherence to our Worldwide Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”) available at https://secure.ethicspoint.com/domain/media/en/gui/2536/code.pdf. The Code of Conduct requires employees to comply with the applicable laws of the places where SanDisk does business. SanDisk also provides an anonymous hotline in which to report any actual or suspected violations regarding, among other things, slavery and human trafficking. SanDisk policy is to not retaliate against persons bringing forward actual or suspected violations.

Training

SanDisk provides training on mitigating the risks of human trafficking and slavery in supply chains to our employees and management with direct responsibility for supply chain oversight. Such training is available as instructor-led sessions or online through our internal learning and development system. A refresh of the training is expected in 2015."

Bourns, Inc. (“Bourns”) seeks to use only suppliers which Bourns believes act in a responsible manner, including having no involvement with slavery, human trafficking, forced labor or child labor in violation of international standards. Bourns evaluates suppliers on criteria beyond price. Such criteria include, among others, business history, financial stability, quality, timeliness of delivery, working conditions and compliance with laws.

Bourns requires its direct suppliers to comply with the Bourns Code of Ethics and Conduct which states that:

				Bourns supports the eradication of slavery and human trafficking worldwide and the effective elimination of all forms of forced labor and child labor in violation of international standards; and 

				Bourns will use this objective as a criterion in the selection and management of its suppliers.  Although Bourns expects compliance pursuant to the Bourns Code of Ethics and Conduct, Bourns presently does not require its direct suppliers to provide written certification that materials incorporated into the supplied product comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.  Bourns employees conduct on-site reviews of a majority of significant new direct suppliers which includes personally observing the supplier’s workplace. When evaluating significant new direct suppliers, Bourns typically examines issues associated with the supply chain below that supplier. Beyond these actions, Bourns presently does not engage in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery or use any third parties for this purpose.  When concerns arise, Bourns visits existing suppliers to observe and assess compliance with Bourns’ standards. Under the Bourns Code of Ethics and Conduct, suppliers are obligated to provide Bourns or its representatives with access to the supplier’s premises to assess the supplier’s compliance with the standards and expectations of the Bourns Code of Ethics and Conduct. Bourns’ policy is not to use any independent third parties to audit its suppliers for compliance with the Bourns Code of Ethics and Conduct, either on an announced or unannounced basis.  Bourns also requires its employees, including those with supply chain management responsibilities, to review, understand and comply with the Bourns Code of Ethics and Conduct. Bourns currently does not provide training specific to the mitigation of human trafficking and slavery.  Bourns’ policy is to cease doing business with any supplier that fails to meet Bourns’ standards regarding slavery and human trafficking. Any Bourns employee that violates the Bourns Code of Ethics and Conduct is subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment."

As one of the most recognized brands in consumer-electronics retailing, RadioShack Corporation has developed policies that reflect responsible business practices across the organization and throughout the global community of business partners and stakeholders. 

RadioShack has a longstanding corporate Code of Ethics Policy and a Supplier Code of Conduct that set clear boundaries for the relationships and practices with our suppliers and other business partners. Under these policies, RadioShack strives to do business with high moral, ethical and legal standards. RadioShack’s goal is to forge relationships with those suppliers who share our commitment to these standards.

In compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, effective Jan. 1, 2012, RadioShack is providing consumers with a summary of our practices covered by the Act so they are equipped to make informed choices about supporting RadioShack as a community-based retailer of innovative technology products and services. 

Disclosure

RadioShack is committed to compliance with all federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations that apply to its business. This compliance extends to RadioShack’s efforts to require that its suppliers comply with all applicable laws and, likewise, participate in the global effort to eradicate human trafficking and other instances of forced labor.

RadioShack enters into binding, written supply contracts with suppliers who wish to conduct business with RadioShack. The primary document used for this purpose is RadioShack’s Vendor Agreement, which incorporates RadioShack’s applicable policies in the Vendor Guide and Supplier Code of Conduct. As required by these policies, suppliers must comply with all applicable U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations, as well as applicable foreign laws, regulations and rules. RadioShack has the right to refuse any product offered by a supplier that fails to comply with all such laws and regulations.

As required by the Vendor Guide’s Supplier Code of Conduct, RadioShack’s suppliers must provide safe working conditions, treat their employees with respect and dignity, must not subject any employee to any physical or other form of abuse, and must engage in fair and reasonable practices relating to hiring, training, wages, benefits, discipline, termination and retirement, consistent with local standards and applicable law.

RadioShack’s Supplier Code of Conduct explicitly forbids use of forced, bonded, indentured or prison labor by its suppliers and also includes requirements concerning minimum age and compliance with other related local laws.

RadioShack requires that its suppliers must not employ or conduct business with any persons or entities that are blocked by U.S. agencies, including purchase of components, products or services from those countries or vendors that may be blocked or embargoed as a result of labor practices. RadioShack requires our suppliers to monitor changes in status on various lists published by federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Further, RadioShack’s suppliers are to implement, maintain and enforce appropriate policies, record-keeping practices and procedures to promote compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct and applicable laws.

Supply Chain Verification and Audits

RadioShack retains third-party auditing firms to evaluate and verify compliance with its Supplier Code of Conduct. RadioShack reserves the right to conduct these visits and audits unannounced, and will do so should the need arise. RadioShack is committed to ongoing dialogue with our suppliers concerning local labor practices in the interest of continuing to improve the quality and transparency of our global supply chain. 

Internal Accountability

If any of these facility visits or audits identifies deficiencies, the supplier must promptly develop and implement corrective actions to eliminate the identified deficiencies. RadioShack closely monitors the implementation of the necessary corrective action plan. The supplier’s failure to eliminate any identified deficiency in accordance with the Vendor Agreement, Vendor Guide and Supplier Code of Conduct may result in RadioShack’s termination of any and all applicable business relationships. 

Training

In addition to annual employee training on its ethics standards, RadioShack also conducts annual training sessions to inform all employees who are directly involved with global sourcing activities of the definitions of forced labor, human trafficking, common illegal labor practices, and RadioShack’s policies and procedures, as well as RadioShack’s reporting responsibilities concerning these activities. Properly educating these employees is a key element of RadioShack’s efforts to maintain and promote responsible practices in the global supply chain.

RadioShack is committed to conducting its business and operations consistent with legally recognized standards for corporate responsibility. RadioShack expects each of our suppliers in our direct supply chain to similarly conform to these standards and to fulfill the goals of responsible corporate citizenship.

1. Levi Strauss & Co. assesses the risk related to the apparel supply chain. Levi Strauss & Co.’s commitment to responsible business practices - embodied in our Global Sourcing and Operational Guidelines - guides our decisions and behavior as a company everywhere we do business. Since becoming the first multinational to establish such guidelines in 1991, Levi Strauss & Co. has used them to help improve the lives of workers manufacturing our products, make responsible sourcing decisions, and protect our commercial interests. The guidelines are a cornerstone of our business relationships with hundreds of contractors worldwide.

Levi Strauss & Co. utilizes Country Assessment Guidelines, which are part of the Global Sourcing and Operating Guidelines, to help assess any country-level issues that might present concern in light of the ethical principles we have set for ourselves. The Guidelines assist Levi Strauss & Co. in understanding risks and opportunities associated with conducting business in specific countries, including forced and prison labor.

Our Terms of Engagement (TOE), the contractor-specific component of our Global Sourcing and Operating Guidelines, specify the requirements by which all of our contract factories and licensees must abide — including ethical standards, legal requirements, environmental requirements and community involvement. They also set out employment standards and specifically address issues of child labor, forced labor, disciplinary practices, working hours, wages and benefits, freedom of association, discrimination, and health and safety. Learn more about the TOE and our product sourcing requirements. Our risk assessment is performed internally.

2. Levi Strauss & Co. conducts audits of our suppliers based on the conditions outlined in our Terms of Engagement. We employ full-time factory assessors, located around the world where our suppliers are. These experts understand the scope of our labor and environment, health and safety standards and know the local languages, laws, culture and business context of each country in which we operate. They conduct regular assessments of every factory contracted to manufacture our products. These assessments are based on standards found in our Social and Environmental Sustainability Guidebook, which all our suppliers receive in their local language. These assessments involve on-site and off-site discussions with workers, management interviews, review of factory records (such as timecards and payroll) and environment, health and safety inspections. Each assessment identifies areas for improvement and a detailed corrective action plan, including actions, responsible parties, and timelines. Regular follow-up visits are also conducted, to ensure suppliers are completing their corrective action plans on a timely basis.

We conduct both announced and unannounced audits that are performed by a third-party monitors or trained employees. We use third-party monitors for our product licensee suppliers of non-core products, including belts, watches, glasses and other accessories, and to supplement our own monitoring efforts. All third-party monitors used for our direct and licensee suppliers must be approved by Levi Strauss & Co. through a process that involves interviews and screening for proper qualifications. Once screened, the candidates must attend a Levi Strauss &Co. assessor training and pass an assessment review that includes a one-on-one, post-training interview with a Levi Strauss & Co. senior TOE assessor and a “shadow audit” in the field. Approximately 70 individual third-party monitors currently are approved to conduct TOE assessments in licensee factories.

  



3. Levi Strauss & Co.’s purchasing agreements require all suppliers to comply with applicable laws within the country of business, as well as our Global Sourcing and Operating Guidelines and our Terms of Engagement regarding forced and prison labor.

4. Levi Strauss & Co. maintains and enforces internal accountability procedures for employees and contractors regarding company standards in slavery and human trafficking. In the case of non- compliance, Levi Strauss & Co. reserves the right to examine the specific situation and develop a best possible strategy for resolution. If cases of non-compliance are not resolved within a timely manner, Levi Strauss & Co. may terminate the business relationship. While Levi Strauss & Co. wishes to aid in the resolution of incidences of human trafficking and slavery within Levi Strauss & Co.’s supply chain, it is not possible to effectively solve the issue of noncompliance without the cooperation of the supplier.

5. Levi Strauss & Co. conducts internal training on the Worldwide Code of Business Conduct annually to ensure we provide our employees with a clear set of standards and guidance for conducting our business with integrity and the highest degree of compliance with the law. Additionally, Levi Strauss & Co. conducts internal training of our supply chain management to ensure management are knowledgeable and aware of the issues and concerns surrounding the supply chain, including human trafficking and slavery, with a particular focus on mitigating risks."
