(i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time, but not after, the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, if a written Acquisition Proposal that did not otherwise result from a breach (other than an unintentional or de minimis breach) of Section 6.1 is received by the Company, and the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s) that such Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may, if the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary -40-             duties under applicable Law, (x) effect a Change of Recommendation and/or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) in order to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company pays to Parent any Company Termination Payment required to be paid pursuant to Section 8.2(b)(i); provided further, that, prior to taking such action described in clauses (x) and/or (y) above, (A) the Company shall give Parent written notice four (4) Business Days in advance (such period from the time the Company Notice is provided until 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the fourth (4 th) Business Day immediately following the day on which the Company delivered the Company Notice, the “Notice Period”), which notice shall set forth in writing (I) that the Board of Directors of the Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal that would, if consummated, constitute a Superior Proposal, (II) the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal (including the consideration offered therein and the identity of the Person or group making the Acquisition Proposal) and shall have contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the Acquisition Proposal and all other documents (other than immaterial documents) related to the Superior Proposal and (III) advise Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(ii) in order to enter into a definitive written agreement providing for such Superior Proposal (such notice, the “Company Notice”), (B) after giving such Company Notice and as a condition precedent to taking any action described in clauses (x) or (y) above, the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent requested by Parent), to make such revisions to the terms of this Agreement as would cause such Acquisition Proposal to cease to be a Superior Proposal and (C) at the end of the Notice Period, prior to and as a condition precedent to taking any action described in clauses (x) or (y) above, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take into account in good faith any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent in response to the Company Notice and any other information offered by Parent in response to the Company Notice, and shall have determined in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor(s) that such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, if such changes offered in writing by Parent (if any) were to be given effect.

B	154	6.3      TCF Shareholder Approval.   (a)  TCF shall take, in accordance with applicable law and the TCF Articles and TCF Bylaws, all actions necessary to convene a meeting of its shareholders (the “TCF Meeting”) to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite TCF Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger. Except in the case of a TCF Adverse Recommendation Change, the Board of Directors of TCF shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of TCF the Requisite TCF Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement) that they approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the “TCF Board Recommendation”) and shall not make a TCF Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with this Section 6.3.

Any material amendment to any TCF Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new TCF Acquisition Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.3 and will require a new notice period as referred to in this Section 6.3.
