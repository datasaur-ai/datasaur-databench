If requested by Parent, the Company will, and will cause its Representatives to, during the Notice Period, engage in good faith negotiations with Parent and its Representatives (including by making the Company’s officers and Representatives reasonably available to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that (i) in the case of an Acquisition Proposal, such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that if Parent has committed to any changes to the terms of this Agreement, each time thereafter that there has been any subsequent amendment to any material term of such Superior Proposal, the Company Board of Directors shall provide a new Company Notice and an additional two (2) Business Day period from the date of such notice and the obligations of the Company during the Notice Period shall continue in effect during such additional period) or (ii) in the case of an Intervening Event, the failure of the Company Board of Directors to make a Company Change of Recommendation could not be reasonably expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws. Any such Company Change of Recommendation shall not change the approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the Company Board of Directors in any respect that would have the effect of causing any corporate takeover statute or other similar statute or any provision of the Company Articles of Incorporation to be applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.
