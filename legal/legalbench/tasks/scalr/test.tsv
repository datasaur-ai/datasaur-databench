2	holding that the State's asserted interest in political stability amounts to a desire to protect existing political parties from competition generated by independent candidates who have previously been affiliated with a party, an interest that conflicts with First Amendment values	holding political subdivision's five percent signature requirement for independent candidates and new political parties violative of the Equal Protection Clause insofar as it required more than the 25,000 signatures required for candidates to appear on state-wide ballots	holding no compelling interest in “leveling the playing field” via election funding statute for Free Speech Clause purposes	holding that the independent candidates’ challenge to Illinois’s ballot access signature requirement was not moot without explicitly addressing the likelihood that the same independent candidates would seek to run again	holding that although the 1972 election was long over, the case was not moot because the issues presented and their effects on independent candidates would persist since the challenged statutes would apply to future elections	488	"In Davis v. FEC, 128 S. Ct. 2759 (2008), this Court held that the First Amendment forbids the government from attempting to level the playing field in elections by raising contribution limits for candidates who are outspent by self-financed opponents. Arizona's Citizens Clean Elections Act achieves a similar result by providing extra subsidies in the form of ""matching funds"" to publicly financed candidates who are outspent by independent expenditure groups and privately financed candidates. The questions presented are:
Whether the First Amendment forbids Arizona from providing additional government subsidies to publicly financed candidates that are triggered by independent expenditure groups' speech against such candidates?"
0	"holding that where ""a plausible interpretation of the statute"" exists that would preserve the United States’ sovereign immunity, a court must adopt it"	"holding that a constitutional challenge to discretionary civil remedies under RICO had not ripened, and explaining that ""[t]hese claims can only be reviewed when (or if) such remedies are enforced against petitioner."""	"holding that general damages are not available under Section 552a(g)(D), and monetary damages require: intentional or willful action; and actual damages, not merely an ""adverse effect"""	"holding that ""the basic purpose of a § 1983 damages award should be to compensate persons for injuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights,"" and that ""mental and emotional distress caused by the denial of procedural due process itself is compensable under § 1983"""	holding that in a case brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C. §§ 51- 60, a plaintiff already suffering from asbestosis can recover emotional distress damages associated with fear of developing cancer, but a disease-free plaintiff merely exposed to asbestos cannot recover emotional distress damages	400	"Whether a plaintiff who alleges only mental and emotional injuries can establish ""actual damages"" within the meaning of the civil remedies provision of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(4)(A)."
1	holding that, when it is an open question whether a federal statute provides private parties with a cause of action enforceable under section 1983, there is a sufficient controversy to support jurisdiction	"holding that the design-to-conceal element ""can[not] . . . be satisfied solely by evidence that a defendant concealed the funds during their transport"""	holding that a company’s contractual obligation to pay royalties for the use of inventor’s product design was enforceable despite the fact that the design was not patentable and other competitors were free to copy the design without paying royalties	holding that for the offense of money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1956(B) and 1957, the existence of criminally generated proceeds was a circumstance element of the offense and, therefore, that where the laundered funds were unlawfully generated was irrelevant for venue purposes	holding that venue for money laundering conspiracy is proper either in the district where the complete substantive money laundering offense had been accomplished or where an over act in furtherance of the conspiracy was committed	262	Whether merely hiding funds with no design to create the appearance of legitimate wealth is sufficient to support a money laundering conviction.
0	holding that where the state is the plaintiff in a parens patriae suit, even where the claim for restitution is based on injuries suffered by many citizens of the state, the suit does not constitute a “mass action” under CAFA	holding that in action brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act, plaintiff could not assert state claims against a second defendant without independent base of federal jurisdiction	holding that where § 301 of the Taft Hartley applies, the case is removable even if only state law claims appear in the complaint	holding that, where ERISA completely preempts all state law claims raised, the case is removable under federal question jurisdiction despite the lack of any federal issues raised in the plaintiffs “well-pleaded” complaint	"holding that a district court may decline to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims by considering a ""host"" of factors, ""including the circumstances of the particular case, the nature of the state law claims, and the character of the governing state law, and the relationship between the state and federal claims"""	29	"Whether a state's parens patriae action is removable as a ""mass action"" under the Class Action Fairness Act when the state is the sole plaintiff, the claims arise under state law, and the state attorney general possesses statutory and common-law authority to assert all claims in the complaint."
0	holding that witnesses in a grand jury proceeding, including complaining witnesses, are entitled to absolute immunity from liability under § 1983 for their grand jury testimony	holding that absolute judicial immunity does not bar prospective injunctive relief under Sec. 1983 against a state-court judge acting in a judicial capacity	holding that prison guards employed by a private prison are not entitled to qualified immunity from suits under § 1983, but that whether the private defendants acted under color of state law in violation of § 1983 was a matter to be determined by the district court	"holding that ""state and regional legislators are entitled to absolute immunity from liability under § 1983 for their legislative activities."""	"holding that ""42 U.S.C. § 1983 [did not] authorize[] a convicted person to assert a claim against a police officer for giving perjured testimony at his criminal trial"" and also ""that witnesses are absolutely immune from damages liability based on their testimony"""	485	"In Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U.S. 325 (1983), this Court held that law enforcement officials enjoy absolute immunity from civil liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for perjured testimony that they provide at trial. But in Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335 (1986), this Court held that law enforcement officials are not entitled to absolute immunity when they act as ""complaining witnesses"" to initiate a criminal prosecution by submitting a legally invalid arrest warrant. The federal courts of appeals have since divided about how Briscoe and Malley apply when government officials act as ""complaining witnesses"" by testifying before a grand jury or at another judicial proceeding. The question presented in this case is:
Whether a government official who acts as a ""complaining witness"" by presenting perjured testimony against an innocent citizen is entitled to absolute immunity from a Section 1983 claim for civil damages."
2	"holding that the core judicial inquiry in cases where prison officials are accused of using excessive force in the prison disturbance context is ""whether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm"""	holding that a prisoner's claim for injunctive relief and a declaration that his transfer from a medium-security to a maximum-security prison without a hearing was unconstitutional was moot because the prisoner had been transferred back to the medium-security prison	"holding that a court ""must examine the record to see whether the [party moving for summary judgment], in depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, affidavits and the like, has demonstrated the absence of a genuine [dispute] of material fact, and his entitlement to judgment as a matter of law."""	holding that in the First Amendment context “a prison inmate retains those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system.”	"holding that, where prison overcrowding was due to state budget shortfalls, a court-mandated prison-population limit was ""necessary to remedy the violation of prisoners' constitutional rights"" under the Prison Litigation Reform Act"	481	Does a prison policy that denies newspapers, magazines, and photographs to the most difficult inmates in the prison system in an effort to promote security and good behavior violate the First Amendment under the standards of Turner and Overton?
3	"holding that the ""residual clause"" of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e), is constitutionally vague"	"holding that for purposes of §924(c)(1), ""the firearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime; its presence or involvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence"""	holding that under statute prohibiting the use or carrying of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, fact that firearm was a machine gun was an element of the offense to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, rather than a sentencing factor	holding that the residual clause in the definition of crime of violence in using, carrying, or possessing a firearm, found in 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(B), is unconstitutionally vague	"holding that § 924(c) constitutes a continuing offense for purposes of venue where the predicate offense is a continuing offense: ""In our view, § 924(c) does not define a `point-in-time' offense when a firearm is used during and in relation to a continuing crime of violence."""	489	"Whether the subsection-specific definition of ""crime of violence"" in 18 U.S.C. 924(c)(3) (B), which applies only in the limited context of a federal criminal prosecution for possessing, using, or carrying a firearm in connection with acts comprising such a crime, is unconstitutionally vague."
0	"holding that a ""notice error"" was harmless because the respondent ""ha[d] not explained to the Veterans Court, to the Federal Circuit, or to us how the notice error to which he points could have made any difference"""	"holding that Congress, in enacting veteran's benefit statute using term ""willful misconduct,"" is presumed to be aware of prior Veterans' Administration interpretation of the term"	"holding that upon the return of an unclaimed notice of a tax sale, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires the state to ""take additional reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the property owner before selling his property, if it is practicable to do so"""	holding that a statutory fee limitation for lawyers representing veterans challenging the termination of benefits was constitutional because, among other things, the overall reversal rate for agency decisions was only sixteen percent and the success rate for veterans with representation was, at most, only three percent better than claimants without representation	"holding that provision barring review of ""`decisions of the Administrator on any question of law or fact under any law administered by the Veterans' Administration providing benefits for veterans'"" did not bar constitutional challenge (emphasis deleted)"	307	"The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096, requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide a notice to benefits claimants. Under 38 U.S.C. 7261(b)(2) (Supp. V 2005), review of administrative decisions resolving claims for veterans benefits must “take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.” The question presented is:
Whether the court of appeals erred in holding that a failure of the VA to give the notice required by the VCAA must be presumed to be prejudicial."
2	holding that a change in the law, if merely procedural, does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, even if detrimental to the defendant	holding that application of a revision of Florida's sentencing guidelines applied to a defendant convicted before the legislature passed the guidelines violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because the new guidelines increased the length of the defendant's punishment	"holding that sentencing a defendant ""under Guidelines promulgated after he committed his criminal acts"" violates the Ex Post Facto clause of the United States Constitution if ""the new version provides a higher applicable Guidelines sentencing range than the version in place at the time of the offense"""	holding that the Ex Post Facto Clause of the U.S. Constitution precluded application of a statute to offenses committed before its effective date	"holding that while ""limitations on ex post facto judicial decisionmaking are inherent in the notion of due process,"" the Due Process Clause does not incorporate the specific prohibitions of the Ex Post Facto Clause"	405	"The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual directs a court to ""use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced"" unless ""the court determines that use of the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution."" Eight courts of appeals have held that the Ex Post Facto Clause is violated where retroactive application of the Sentencing Guidelines creates a significant risk of a higher sentence. In the decision below, however, the Seventh Circuit has held that the Ex Post Facto Clause is never violated by retroactive application of the Sentencing Guidelines because the Guidelines are advisory, not mandatory.
Does a sentencing court violate the Ex Post Facto Clause by using the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing rather than the Guidelines in effect at the time of the offense, if the newer Guidelines create a significant risk that the defendant will receive a longer sentence?"
3	"holding that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of a death sentence did not have to be made by a jury because the existence of aggravating factors was not an element of the offense but merely a ""sentencing factor"""	"holding that ""a capital sentencing scheme must `genuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty'"""	holding that the Arizona capital sentencing scheme, which allowed the court and not the jury to make factual findings underlying a capital sentencing decision, did not offend the Sixth Amendment	holding Walton compelled conclusion Kansas capital sentencing scheme satisfied Eighth Amendment requirements because Kansas scheme was functionally identical to scheme found constitutional in Walton, except it provided benefit to defendants by placing no evidentiary burden on them	holding that it is unconstitutional for the sentencing judge to instruct an advisory jury not to consider, and for the sentencing judge to refuse to consider, evidence of non-statutory mitigating circumstances	537	"QUESTION PRESENTED: 
Does it violate the Constitution for a state capital-sentencing statute to provide for the imposition of the death penalty when the sentencing jury determines that the mitigating and aggravating evidence is in equipoise?"
