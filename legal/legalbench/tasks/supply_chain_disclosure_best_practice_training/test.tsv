No	377	"California Transparency in Supply Chain Act

As part of Viterra's core values of honesty, integrity, trust and high performance, the Company's Sustainability Commitment, and in support of the corporate Code of Business Conduct, Viterra Inc. and its subsidiaries doing business in California are committed to complying with the California Transparency in Supply Chain Act.  Viterra also supports the elimination of slavery and human trafficking from product supply chains. 

Viterra's raw material suppliers are primarily producers/farmers with the vast majority of grain origination volumes coming from Canada, Australia and the United States where legal requirements regarding elimination of human trafficking and slavery are robust.  On this basis, the Company believes the current risk of these issues within the supply chain to be very low. 

Viterra's Code of Business Conduct supports and promotes the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Viterra is currently updating its training program for the Code of Business Conduct.  The Company does not currently require direct supplier certification, conduct supplier audits or third party verification with respect to human trafficking and slavery but is considering what steps it may take in the future in this regard."

ABOUT THIS POLICY

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect in the State of California. This law describes the information to be made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts (if any) to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking.

CORPORATE AND SUPPLIER CODES OF CONDUCT

Company Code of Conduct
The Company's Code of Conduct is part of Callaway Golf Company's effort to conduct its global business legally. The Code applies to all board members, officers and employees of Callaway Golf Company and its subsidiaries. All Callaway Golf Company employees are required to comply with the Company's Code of Conduct, which includes provisions designed to address the principle that child, prison, or forced labor are not permitted at any Callaway Golf Company supplier operation. Callaway Golf Company's Code of Conduct is applicable throughout the world, and the Company trains employees on these standards from time to time, including new hire training for all incoming employees and ongoing training of all company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management. This ongoing training specifically addresses education on human trafficking and slavery prohibitions within the product supply chain.

Supplier Code of Conduct
The Company has also adopted and implemented a ""Supplier Code of Conduct."" The Supplier Code of Conduct describes the business practices and employment standards applicable to Callaway Golf's direct suppliers on a global basis. Click to view the Supplier Code of Conduct.

Direct suppliers receive copies of or have access to the Supplier Code of Conduct and many suppliers post the Code on site at their various locations.

HOW WE VERIFY COMPLIANCE

The Company uses various approaches to verify the absence of forced labor and child labor in our supply chain, including the following:

Supply Chain Qualification and Supplier Assessments 
Callaway Golf Company performs assessments of potential suppliers according to a risk-based approach. This approach includes preliminary risk assessments and supplier assessment questionnaires. New supplier screenings are generally conducted internally by Callaway Golf Company personnel. Ongoing supplier compliance is typically monitored by a combination of measures (as discussed below), including supplier self-assessments, Callaway Golf Company-conducted audits and third party audits. Callaway Golf Company uses tools such as regular questionnaires (which are administered by Callaway through a web-based service), that are completed by direct tier one suppliers and selected tier two suppliers.

Supplier Audits 
Callaway Golf Company's audit program evaluates suppliers' compliance with the Company's Supplier Code of Conduct. Various types of announced audits are conducted under this program, including onsite audits conducted or attended by Callaway Golf Company personnel, collaborative or self-audits, and periodic third-party on-site audits of practices and underlying management systems. If deficiencies are identified, suppliers are directed to produce corrective action plans. The corrective action plans typically outline how a supplier will resolve issues uncovered in audits. If any compliance issues are identified, the Company may terminate the supplier relationship or will require action by the supplier to rectify the problem within a designated timeframe.

Currently, site audits are scheduled at most direct supplier sites every two years. These audits are conducted by Callaway Golf Company or by a third party auditing company. The audits are semi-announced audits. This means that the suppliers are given a window of time when the audit will take place, but the exact date of the audit within the timeframe is unannounced.

Terms and Conditions in Purchase Orders and Agreements 
Callaway Golf Company has various agreements or purchasing terms and conditions in place with most direct suppliers, requiring them to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including laws regarding forced labor and child labor.

Corporate Purchasing Policy
Callaway Golf Company has a Corporate Purchasing Policy in place that applies to all US employees responsible for commitment of funds to external suppliers. The Policy also serves as a guide for all non-US employees. Applicable employees are responsible for understanding and complying with this Policy. Among other things, the Policy is designed to promote compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.

Supplier Certifications 
Over the course of the next 12 to 18 months (through 2013), Callaway Golf Company is introducing a program to require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the Company's products comply with the laws of the countries where the suppliers are doing business.

Product Compliance
Callaway Golf Company strives to ensure products comply with applicable laws and regulations through education, testing, certifications and audits.

Conflict Free Sourcing
Callaway Golf Company has policies and procedures to reasonably assure that the use of the tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in the products manufactured do not directly or indirectly finance armed groups in Covered Countries as defined by the Conflict Minerals Rule issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Click to view Callaway’s Conflict Mineral Policy.

Employee and Supplier Training
Callaway Golf Company educates employees responsible for supplier programs on how to identify and report compliance issues. Callaway Golf Company also strives to educate suppliers on relevant regulatory requirements, programs and Company policies.

Company Legal Compliance Committee and Internal Audit Department
Callaway Golf Company has formed a Legal Compliance Committee to address compliance issues on a global basis and to develop systems and procedures to address any ongoing compliance issues in the locations where we conduct operations. The Legal Compliance Committee meets on a regular basis and the Chief Ethics Officer provides updates of key findings to the Callaway Golf Company Board of Directors.

The Company also has an Internal Audit Department that periodically tests supplier compliance with contract terms through a variety of methods. The Company also seeks to promptly address internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet Callaway Golf Company standards.

On September 30, 2010 SB 657, “The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010” was signed into law, for the purpose of eliminating the existence of products sold in California that are made with slave labor at any point in the supply chain. The Act requires certain businesses to disclose the extent and efforts taken to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from each business’ supply chain.

SciClone’s Suppliers

To produce its proprietary products, SciClone has determined to contract only with manufacturers in the United States and Western Europe. SciClone’s primary reason for this practice is to ensure the highest standards of quality for its pharmaceutical products. SciClone also believes that this practice minimizes the possibility that any kind of potential slave labor is used by these direct suppliers in the manufacture of its products. In particular, retention of direct manufacturing suppliers in the United States and Western Europe ensures that our direct suppliers are subject to the labor, health and safety laws and regulations in those jurisdictions.

Supplier Approval

Prior to approving and entering into contracts with manufacturing suppliers, SciClone evaluates suppliers for suitability as a SciClone business partner, and in particular compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Our supplier approval activities are based on our assessment of risk and may include supplier written responses to our inquiries, and on-site inspections of supplier facilities.

Supplier Verification, Auditing and Controls

Once a supplier is selected, SciClone utilizes contract terms, quality agreements, and regular certifications and audits to confirm suppliers’ compliance with SciClone’s supplier performance and quality expectations. Supplier compliance certification and audits are performed by SciClone employees. The frequency of supplier certifications and audits is based upon our assessment of risk as well as the supplier’s performance. Our on-site audits in the United States and Western Europe do not specifically include assessment for human trafficking and slavery activity.

Our agreements with manufacturing suppliers include commitments from our direct suppliers to comply with laws and regulations applicable to their services and the material provided by the supplier, which we believe includes compliance with local labor, health and safety requirements.

Internal Accountability

SciClone requires that all our employees comply with our Corporate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, as well as all company policies and procedures, and all laws and regulations that apply to company business operations. Compliance with laws would include compliance with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. Any violations of SciClone’s policies are subject to disciplinary measures including dismissal as appropriate. For any supplier not meeting SciClone’s requirements under its contractual arrangements, SciClone reserves the right to terminate the agreement.

Training.

All employees receive training as to our Corporate Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, as well as our other policies on compliance with laws and regulations. Employees involved in our manufacturing supply chain may also be trained on specific responsibilities regarding The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act."

DISCLOSURES REQUIRED PURSUANT TO THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY IN SUPPLY CHAINS ACT OF 2010 

The Dow Chemical Company (""Dow"") is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and is committed to promoting socially responsible conduct that aligns to the 10 universally accepted principles, including those related to human rights and labor: (4) the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor and (5) the effective abolition of child labor. These principles are woven throughout The Diamond Standard — Dow's Code of Business Conduct (the ""Code""). All employees of Dow and its subsidiaries, including those with direct responsibility for supply chain management, are expected to know and abide by this Code. Rigorous training on the content and application of the Code is mandatory for each and every employee, and each employee must periodically acknowledge that they have read and agree to comply with the Code. Dow takes seriously and fully investigates all potential legal or Code violations, in a respectful, confidential and fair manner. When an allegation of an employee Code violation is substantiated, an appropriate management team is convened to review the investigation findings and determine a final outcome. Consistent with the severity of the violation, discipline can include verbal or written warning, suspension with or without pay, loss or reduction of bonus or stock options, demotion or, for the most serious offenses or repeated misconduct, employment termination. Dow's Code states: 

Respect for human rights and dignity is a cornerstone of our business. 

We do not use forced or involuntary labor. 

We comply with all applicable child labor laws. 

Dow's commitment, however, does not end here, as Dow's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Liveris, states, ""We believe it is also our responsibility as a corporate citizen to extend these Values [reflected in The Diamond Standard] well beyond our corporate walls."" To this end, in March 2011 Dow unveiled its Code of Business Conduct for Suppliers (the ""Supplier Code""), which clearly articulates the basic principles for supplier conduct when working with Dow. The Supplier Code was sent to over 35,000 Dow suppliers worldwide in March 2011 and posted on Dow.com. Among other things, the Supplier Code sets forth Dow's expectations with respect to Human Rights and Labor: 

No Forced and Compulsory Labor: Suppliers will not use forced or involuntary labor, including prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor or slave labor. 

No Harassment and Abuse of Labor: Suppliers will ensure that their employees are not subjected to psychological, verbal, sexual or physical harassment or to any form of abuse, and will comply with all applicable laws on harassment and abuse of employees. 

No Child Labor: Suppliers will comply with all applicable child labor laws. 

The Supplier Code also details Dow's expectations concerning Suppliers' systems and procedures to ensure compliance for itself and for its suppliers, and the potential consequences of non-compliance: 

Compliance: Dow expects suppliers to implement systems and controls to promote compliance with applicable laws and the principles set forth in this Code, including policies, training, monitoring and auditing mechanisms. Suppliers also should apply these or similar principles to the subcontractors and suppliers they work with in providing goods and services to Dow. Dow reserves the right to assess and monitor suppliers' compliance with this Code. Suppliers who are not in compliance with this Code are expected to implement corrective actions or may not be considered for future business. 

The majority of Dow's standard purchase orders and contract templates have been updated to include new provisions to require suppliers' compliance with the Supplier Code, with the intent that all new Dow suppliers must abide by the Supplier Code. As existing contracts come up for renewal, Dow intends to add similar provisions. In addition, as part of the next phases of Dow's roll out of the Supplier Code and as Suppliers become more familiar, Dow is currently evaluating whether to require compliance certifications, self assessments and/or compliance audits. Currently Dow does utilize a stringent internal supplier qualification process for new suppliers. No decisions have yet been made as to whether future assessments will be verified, or supplier audits conducted by independent third parties, or if audits will be unannounced."

Nike takes seriously the federal and international efforts to end all kinds of forced labor - whether in the form of prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor, human trafficking or otherwise - through standards set forth in our Code of Conduct, originally established by Nike, and subsequently adopted by affiliated companies, including the section ""Employment is Voluntary"".



SUPPLY CHAIN VERIFICATION

STANDARDS FOR COMPLIANCE

No	307	"California Human Trafficking in the Supply Chain Disclosure - CA SB 657

GameStop is committed to conducting its business on the principles of integrity and sound business ethics. We are also committed to holding our manufacturers, vendors and suppliers to these same principles, which include taking measures to ensure that parties we do business with maintain basic labor and human rights standards for their workers.

To this end, GameStop has established a Code of Conduct to which each contract manufacturer for exclusive-branded products must adhere. The Code of Conduct represents GameStop's commitment to source this merchandise from persons and firms that strive to maintain comprehensive corporate responsibility programs and adhere to GameStop's expectations regarding human trafficking, forced labor and a variety of other important issues. Specifically, our Code of Conduct prohibits these manufacturers from utilizing any form of forced labor, whether in the form of child labor, prison labor, bonded labor, indentured labor or otherwise. Manufacturers we contract with who fail to meet these standards would be in breach of our agreement. We also require manufacturers we contract with to ensure their subcontractors adhere to our Code of Conduct.

Members of our direct import and merchandising teams personally visit the factories where our exclusive-branded products are produced. In addition, we have in the past, and will continue to in the future, engage a third party to perform scheduled factory audits of our manufacturing vendors to ensure they are operating within the parameters of our Code of Conduct. These audits will continue on a periodic basis for as long as we do business with each of these manufacturers.

In addition to the above, each contract manufacturer is required to independently maintain sufficient documentation of its compliance with our Code of Conduct. GameStop will quickly investigate any reports of human trafficking anywhere in its supply chain, and will take swift action against any supplier that is found to have acted improperly. While contract manufacturers are not required to certify that all materials incorporated into the products they produce comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking, both these suppliers and their subcontractors must adhere to the Code of Conduct and certify that all their operations are completely free of any form of child labor, prison labor, bonded labor, indentured labor or otherwise.

In addition, all GameStop merchandising employees who maintain relationships with vendors are required to adhere to the GameStop Code of Standards, Ethics and Conduct. The Code of Standards, Ethics and Conduct requires all employees to observe high ethical standards in the performance of their jobs and in their relationships with customers, vendors, their community, and their coworkers. Failure by an employee to follow the standards set forth in the Code of Standards, Ethics and Conduct may subject such employee to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment."
