No	377	"CALIFORNIA SUPPLY CHAIN DISCLOSURE

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect in the State of California. As a result, many companies manufacturing or selling products in California are required to disclose their efforts to address the issues of human trafficking and slavery, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support.

Volcano Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, ""Volcano"" “us’ or “we”) strive to achieve and maintain the highest possible standards of corporate integrity and ethical behavior. We expect our direct suppliers of tangible goods we offer for sale (“suppliers”) and other business partners (collectively, “Business Partners”) will conduct their businesses not only in a lawful manner but also in compliance with the same high standards of integrity and ethics. It is our expectation that our Business Partners will not support, promote or engage in the practice of slavery or human trafficking. Our Business Partners are further expected to take reasonable and necessary steps to help ensure that their sub-contractors and sub- suppliers conduct business in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. To that end, we disclose the following:

Verifications:

As of February 23, 2015, we have required our suppliers to complete a Supplier Survey as part of our initial intake process and are currently in the process of updating our supplier surveys to require suppliers to self-certify specifically regarding eradication of human trafficking and slavery. Specifically, we are in the process of enhancing our Supplier Survey to require our suppliers to evaluate, address and certify that they comply with all applicable laws including:

o Eradication of human trafficking and slavery including forced, bonded, indentured, involuntary, convict or compulsory labor, by any of the following means: (i) by means of force, threats of force, physical restraint, or threats of physical restraint to that person or another person; (ii) by means of serious harm or threats of serious harm to that person or another person; (iii) by means of the abuse or threatened abuse of law or legal process; (iv) by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause the person to believe that, if that person did not perform such labor or services, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint; or (v) by means of acts involved in the recruitment, abduction, transport, harboring, transfer, sale or receipt of persons within national or across international borders, through force, coercion, fraud or deception, to place persons in situations of slavery or slavery-like conditions, forced labor or services such as domestic servitude, bonded sweatshop labor or other debt bondage.

o Eradication of illegal child labor, including compliance with all minimum age requirements as determined by applicable local laws and regulations and by not producing goods for Volcano with: (i) the sale and trafficking of children; (ii) debt bondage and serfdom; (iii) forced or compulsory labor; (iv) use, procuring, or offering of a child for illicit activities; or (v) work which is likely to harm the health, safety, or morals of children;

o Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations governing labor and employment, including wages, hours, days of service, rest period, overtime, non-discrimination and freedom of association;

o Compliance with all applicable occupational safety and environmental laws and regulations; and

Verifications are conducted through Supplier Survey and self-verifications and certifications. Volcano however reserves the right to engage in its own verification process of its suppliers or by engaging a third party to conduct such verifications.

Audits:

Volcano does not currently, but is in the process of expressly reserving the right to conduct onsite audits of its suppliers to evaluate the supplier's compliance with Volcano’s Supplier Survey and supplier’s self- certifications. Volcano may conduct such audits through its own personnel or through a third party independent auditor, on an announced or unannounced basis.

Materials:

Volcano’s Purchase Order terms and conditions currently require our suppliers to certify that the materials incorporated into their products comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

Accountability Standards:

Our global Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (our “Code of Conduct”), which applies to all of our Business Partners, sets forth our statements and beliefs regarding the manner in which our employees and Business Partners must conduct themselves when performing functions for or on behalf of Volcano. The Code of Conduct specifically requires that our Business Partners comply with all laws and regulations relating to human trafficking and slavery.

Our Code of Conduct also provides that if guidance on a legal or ethical question is required, or if an illegal or unethical activity has been witnessed (including activities pertaining to human trafficking and slavery), the applicable Volcano employee or Business Partner representative should consult with or report the matter (i) to his or her supervisor or Volcano senior management, (ii) to Volcano’s Chief Compliance Officer (or his designee), Legal Department, or Human Resources Department, or (iii) otherwise as contemplated by our Code of Conduct, depending on the specific circumstances and consistent with local data privacy laws. All reports of alleged violations will be promptly investigated by us. If the results of an investigation indicate that corrective action is required, the relevant party or parties will be held accountable and we will decide the appropriate steps to take, including discipline, dismissal, termination of contractual relations, and/or possible legal proceedings. If appropriate, the investigation may be turned over to the applicable outside authorities, and outside investigators may assist in the inquiry. We expect our Business Partners to take prompt and decisive corrective action to address any deficiencies identified with respect to their compliance with applicable laws, regulations or internationally recognized standards of conduct applicable to slavery and human trafficking. Disregard or deliberate ignorance of the law is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.

Training:

Volcano is in the process of training and educating our employees and Business Partners on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We will continue to highlight and discuss Volcano’s intolerance of any form of slavery or human trafficking, as well as our position that all of our employees and Business Partners must refrain from engaging in, facilitating or supporting any such practice. We will be placing a particular focus on our employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, with respect to mitigation risks within the supply chain."
Yes	86	"California’s Transparency in Supply Chains Law

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (Cal. Civ. Code § 1714.43) went into effect. This law, passed by the California state legislature, increases the amount of information made available by retailers and manufacturers concerning their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains.

Forced labor and human trafficking can take many forms, including child labor. Exelis Inc. and its affiliated companies (collectively “Exelis”) has a zero-tolerance policy for any such forced labor, human trafficking or child labor used in the manufacture of the products it purchases or the products it provides.

Background

Exelis has a long standing commitment to conducting its business fairly, impartially, and in an ethical and proper manner. Exelis is committed to conducting business in a manner that respects and advances human rights based on intrinsic corporate values and operating principles. Exelis upholds human rights at all times and in all locations, regardless of local business customs.

In particular, Exelis is committed to:

• Providing safe and secure conditions for those working on our Company’s behalf

• Protecting the environment

• Following all applicable wage and hour laws

• Strictly prohibiting human trafficking and the use of child or forced labor, including prison or bonded labor

• Treating each other fairly and equitably

To ensure that every facet of our business upholds these standards, Exelis expects every supplier with whom it transacts business, regardless of location, to share these commitments.

Practices and Policies

I. Verification of product supply chain to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery

Exelis communicates their expectations through standard conditions of purchase and obtains verification through an Annual Supplier certification process that every supplier in performing obligations under an agreement with Exelis will not use child labor as defined by local law, will not use forced or compulsory labor, and will not physically abuse labor. Each supplier must further assure compliance with all applicable wage and benefit, working hours, overtime and health, safety and environmental matters, laws and regulations.

II. Audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery

Through its conditions of purchase, Exelis reserves the right to require each supplier to demonstrate compliance with all requirements regarding forced labor, human trafficking or child labor and inspect any site a supplier may use in manufacturing or providing products for Exelis.

III. Internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or suppliers failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking

Exelis maintains a Code of Conduct for all employees. Any employee who fails to abide by the human trafficking, forced and child labor provisions of the Exelis Code of Conduct will be subject to disciplinary action, which may include termination. In addition, Exelis expects suppliers, who have cause to believe that an Exelis employee or agent of Exelis has behaved improperly or unethically, to report such behaviors to an Exelis Point of Contact (POC). These POC’s, along with the Code of Conduct are made available to all suppliers on the Exelis website located at http://www.exelisinc.com.

A supplier’s failure to comply with the company standards regarding forced labor, human trafficking or child labor shall be cause for immediate termination of the engagement/relationship.

IV. Training on human trafficking and slavery

All Exelis personnel, regardless of position, receive annual training on the Code of Conduct, which includes updates and discussions on forced labor, human trafficking and child labor laws and the impact they have to how Exelis conducts its business and how it sources and manufactures its products."
Yes	253	"California Transparency
in Supply Chains Act



On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (also referred to as SB 657) became law. The Act requires that companies disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains.

West Marine does not condone the use of slavery or human trafficking and does not knowingly do business with any supplier who engages in such practice. Long before the passage of this law, West Marine’s Supplier Agreements contained contractual provisions prohibiting the use of involuntary labor and child labor, and requiring compliance with applicable labor laws, safe working conditions and employment laws.

West Marine Associates who work as merchant buyers and in our resourcing and quality teams receive training on how to recognize and mitigate the risks of slavery and human trafficking. To assist in verifying our Supplier’s operations, West Marine Associates --our merchant buyers and our resourcing and quality teams-- periodically visit third party Supplier facilities. West Marine has also previously engaged third party auditors to monitor certain of its supply chains in order to evaluate and to address the risks of slavery and human trafficking inherent in those activities. West Marine will again look to engaging a third party independent firm to make unannounced visits to Supplier facilities in the future.

We are currently taking additional steps to prevent slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains. Those measures include requiring each Supplier to acknowledge an understanding of their obligations with regard to these laws and to certify that materials incorporated into the merchandise they supply West Marine is compliant with applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.

West Marine expects its suppliers to conduct themselves in a lawful and ethical manner. West Marine is free to take its business elsewhere should a supplier fall short of these expectations. If a Supplier is found to not be compliant with its obligations, West Marine would have the option to terminate its business relationship with that Supplier or take other actions to remediate any problems that had been identified."

The Silgan Containers Supplier Code of Responsibility for Compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

Silgan Containers maintains a valuable reputation in the business community for honesty and fair dealing by acting ethically and in accordance with the laws applicable to its business. It is Silgan's expectation that each of its suppliers will likewise conduct its business in a legal and ethical manner.

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (""California Law"") addresses issues of slavery and human trafficking, which are crimes under state, federal and international laws. In support of this law, Silgan requires that its major manufacturing suppliers comply with their obligations under the California Law. Specifically, in supply agreements executed after the effective date of the California Law, Silgan requires certification of compliance with the California Law by those suppliers that are covered by the law, and that the supplier comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the countries in which the supplier produces its products. Silgan verifies such compliance in periodic contractual compliance audits that Silgan conducts. At times of contract renewals, Silgan reviews the certifications from these suppliers as it assesses their performance and determines which suppliers it will continue to do business with. Thus, Silgan maintains internal standards and procedures for its employees and contractors that fail to meet Silgan's standards regarding slavery and human trafficking. Silgan conducts training sessions on a periodic basis for Silgan purchasing managers with respect to the California Law."

12/29/11

The following are our thoughts related to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) and work done to address risks of human trafficking and slavery.

We have great concern for the rights of all who work to provide products sold in our stores. We address such matters in our agreements with our suppliers; in fact, the code of conduct in our agreements requires that our suppliers:

…represent and warrant that the goods sold to TJ's were produced, harvested, manufactured, processed, packaged, labeled, transported, delivered, and sold in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations of the United States of America and all of its subdivisions and, if applicable, the laws of any other country, state, or international governing body… that the goods sold to TJ's were not produced, harvested, manufactured, processed, packaged, labeled, transported, or delivered using forced or prison labor or forced or illegal child labor.

We monitor compliance with our agreement through scheduled and unannounced visits and audits of our suppliers' facilities, using our own crew members and third-party groups.

If any of our suppliers are found to be not in compliance with our agreement, we will terminate the relationship.

As we expect our suppliers to abide by these requirements, it also our expectation that Trader Joe's Crew Members follow suit. We hold ourselves accountable to these standards and work to inform and train our people covering the supply chain of the products we offer our customers on the risks of human trafficking and slavery."

1. Levi Strauss & Co. assesses the risk related to the apparel supply chain. Levi Strauss & Co.’s commitment to responsible business practices - embodied in our Global Sourcing and Operational Guidelines - guides our decisions and behavior as a company everywhere we do business. Since becoming the first multinational to establish such guidelines in 1991, Levi Strauss & Co. has used them to help improve the lives of workers manufacturing our products, make responsible sourcing decisions, and protect our commercial interests. The guidelines are a cornerstone of our business relationships with hundreds of contractors worldwide.

Levi Strauss & Co. utilizes Country Assessment Guidelines, which are part of the Global Sourcing and Operating Guidelines, to help assess any country-level issues that might present concern in light of the ethical principles we have set for ourselves. The Guidelines assist Levi Strauss & Co. in understanding risks and opportunities associated with conducting business in specific countries, including forced and prison labor.

Our Terms of Engagement (TOE), the contractor-specific component of our Global Sourcing and Operating Guidelines, specify the requirements by which all of our contract factories and licensees must abide — including ethical standards, legal requirements, environmental requirements and community involvement. They also set out employment standards and specifically address issues of child labor, forced labor, disciplinary practices, working hours, wages and benefits, freedom of association, discrimination, and health and safety. Learn more about the TOE and our product sourcing requirements. Our risk assessment is performed internally.

2. Levi Strauss & Co. conducts audits of our suppliers based on the conditions outlined in our Terms of Engagement. We employ full-time factory assessors, located around the world where our suppliers are. These experts understand the scope of our labor and environment, health and safety standards and know the local languages, laws, culture and business context of each country in which we operate. They conduct regular assessments of every factory contracted to manufacture our products. These assessments are based on standards found in our Social and Environmental Sustainability Guidebook, which all our suppliers receive in their local language. These assessments involve on-site and off-site discussions with workers, management interviews, review of factory records (such as timecards and payroll) and environment, health and safety inspections. Each assessment identifies areas for improvement and a detailed corrective action plan, including actions, responsible parties, and timelines. Regular follow-up visits are also conducted, to ensure suppliers are completing their corrective action plans on a timely basis.

We conduct both announced and unannounced audits that are performed by a third-party monitors or trained employees. We use third-party monitors for our product licensee suppliers of non-core products, including belts, watches, glasses and other accessories, and to supplement our own monitoring efforts. All third-party monitors used for our direct and licensee suppliers must be approved by Levi Strauss & Co. through a process that involves interviews and screening for proper qualifications. Once screened, the candidates must attend a Levi Strauss &Co. assessor training and pass an assessment review that includes a one-on-one, post-training interview with a Levi Strauss & Co. senior TOE assessor and a “shadow audit” in the field. Approximately 70 individual third-party monitors currently are approved to conduct TOE assessments in licensee factories.

  



3. Levi Strauss & Co.’s purchasing agreements require all suppliers to comply with applicable laws within the country of business, as well as our Global Sourcing and Operating Guidelines and our Terms of Engagement regarding forced and prison labor.

4. Levi Strauss & Co. maintains and enforces internal accountability procedures for employees and contractors regarding company standards in slavery and human trafficking. In the case of non- compliance, Levi Strauss & Co. reserves the right to examine the specific situation and develop a best possible strategy for resolution. If cases of non-compliance are not resolved within a timely manner, Levi Strauss & Co. may terminate the business relationship. While Levi Strauss & Co. wishes to aid in the resolution of incidences of human trafficking and slavery within Levi Strauss & Co.’s supply chain, it is not possible to effectively solve the issue of noncompliance without the cooperation of the supplier.

5. Levi Strauss & Co. conducts internal training on the Worldwide Code of Business Conduct annually to ensure we provide our employees with a clear set of standards and guidance for conducting our business with integrity and the highest degree of compliance with the law. Additionally, Levi Strauss & Co. conducts internal training of our supply chain management to ensure management are knowledgeable and aware of the issues and concerns surrounding the supply chain, including human trafficking and slavery, with a particular focus on mitigating risks."
Yes	50	"Corporate disclosure under SB 657 — California Transparency in Supply Chains Act

Central Garden & Pet Company has always sought to operate its business operations so as to respect and further the interests of consumers, customers and the public at large. Our intent is to accomplish this not only through the products we make and sell but also through the processes and relationships that help create these products.

The California Legislature has passed the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) which went into effect on January 1, 2012. This legislation requires that companies that meet certain size or sales standards must disclose what they are doing to monitor and discourage possible slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain aspect of their operations.

We believe that there are no circumstances under which it would be acceptable for forced or trafficked labor to be used in the production of any of our products.

As part of our efforts directed against human trafficking and slavery, we have a rigorous assessment process for all vendors, especially overseas vendors. This assessment process includes questionnaires directed at practices that could implicate issues relevant to human trafficking and slavery. As part of the assessment and verification process, potential vendors are and will be required to certify that they and any materials they use in the making of our products comply with applicable slavery and human trafficking laws. As we reassess existing vendor relationships, they will be required to certify or recertify such compliance. We have also retained a third party inspection company to conduct random inspections of factories that provide us with products or components in order to further assist us in monitoring vendor compliance with human trafficking, and slavery prohibitions.

We also are implementing a program to ensure that agreements with relevant suppliers require strict compliance with company standards regarding forced labor and human trafficking and with international and local legal requirements.

Central maintains internal standards and procedures making both its employees and outside contractors accountable for meeting company requirements relevant to human trafficking and slavery issues. As to outside contractors and vendors, the consequences of failing to meet such requirements can result in financial penalties and suspension or discontinuance of the business relationship.

We also provide company employees with training regarding both the legal requirements applicable to human trafficking and slavery issues and how those requirements impact supply side management. This training is directed at employees and managers who have responsibility for supply side issues and includes topics relevant to both recognition and mitigation of risks relevant to human trafficking and slavery issues."
