SUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATI ONS  
Background  
20. American Renal  operates as a dialysis services provider in the United States 
focused exclusively on joint venture partnerships with physicians.  The Company, through its 
subsidiaries, owns and operates kidney dialysis facilities for patients suffering from chronic kidney  
failure or ESRD .  As of March 31, 2016, it owned and operated 194 dialysis clinics in 25 states 
and the District of Columbia .  
21. On August 31, 2015 , American Renal  filed a draft registration statement with the 
SEC in connection with the Company ’s IPO.  The draft registration statement was subsequently 
amended several times, and the final amended registration statement was filed with the SEC on 
April  20, 201 6 (collectively, the “Registration Statement”).  Case 1:16-cv-06841   Document 1   Filed 08/31/16   Page 5 of 22

Jean Hu,John T Dickson,Balakrishnan S Iyer,Christine King,D Scott Mercer,Jay A Rossiter,George D Wells,William M Zeitler	61	" including the 
material terms and conditions of the proposal and the identity of the party making the 
proposal; (iii) “matching rights” that allow Cavium four (4) business days to match 
any su perior offer; and (iv) a provision requiring QLogic to pay a termination fee of 
$47.8 million if the Company decides to pursue a competing offer.  The collective 
effect of these provisions is to chill any potential post -deal market check.  Case 8:16-cv-01363   Document 1   Filed 07/22/16   Page 3 of 54   Page ID #:3

 5. Additionally, QLo gic insiders stand to gain handsomely from the 
Proposed Transaction.  Motivated by the lucrative incentives of substantial payments 
upon closing, the Board voted unanimously to approve the Proposed Transaction.   
6. Finally, compounding the unfairness of the Proposed Transaction, on 
July 13, 2016, QLogic filed a Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D -9 (the 
“Recommendation Statement”) with the SEC.  The Recommendation Statement, 
which recommends that QLogic stockholders tender their shares in support of the 
Proposed Transaction, omits or misrepresents material information concerning, 
among other things: (i) QLogic’s management’s projections, utilized by Qatalyst 
Partners LP (“Qatalyst”) in its financial analyses; (ii) the valuation analyses prepared 
by Qataly st in connection with the rendering of its fairness opinion; and (iii) material 
information concerning the sale process leading up to the Proposed Transaction.  The 
failure to adequately disclose such material information constitutes a violation of     
§§ 14(d)(4), 14(e) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act as stockholders need such 
information in order to make a fully -informed decision regarding tendering their 
shares in connection with the Proposed Transaction.   
7. In short, the Proposed Transaction is design ed to unlawfully divest 
QLogic’s public stockhold"
