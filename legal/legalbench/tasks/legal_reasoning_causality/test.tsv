Yes	28	"Regarding Tsur's second, and alternative, theory of disparate treatment, that Intel's neutral selection criteria were inherently biased against older workers, the Supreme Court has foreclosed this argument. The Court agrees that Tsur has provided declarations and deposition testimony raising a genuine issue of material fact whether the SSL4 and SSL5 awards, one of the criteria used for the layoffs, were skewed to more senior grade employees. HN13 The Supreme Court, however, rejected disparate treatment ADEA claims when the employer acted ""on the basis of a factor, such as an employee's pension status or seniority, that is empirically correlated with age."" [*27]  Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S. 604, 608, 613, 113 S. Ct. 1701, 123 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1993). In that case, the Supreme Court explained: ""Because age and years of service are analytically distinct, an employer can take account of one while ignoring the other, and thus it is incorrect to say that a decision based on years of service is necessarily 'age based.'"" Id. at 611. ""This is true even if the motivating factor is correlated with age, as pension status typically is. Pension plans typically provide that an employee's accrued benefits will become nonforfeitable, or 'vested,' once the employee completes a certain number of years of service with the employer."" Id."
No	50	"Wills hasn't identified a single similarly-situated comparator. See MSJ Response at 8-10. He doesn't, for example, offer up a white store manager—or, for that matter, any other employee—who yelled at several coworkers (sometimes in front of customers) while throwing merchandise and who, despite this misconduct, wasn't fired. In fact, the record supports the exact opposite conclusion. As Schiller, the ethics case manager, testified: ""[T]he determination was made to terminate Marcellus based on his pattern of harassing and intimidating behavior in his store. And that termination is very consistent with  [*1246]  how we would treat other store managers who behaved the same way."" Schiller Depo. at 51:7-11 (emphasis added). Despite having over nine months to develop the factual record in this case, Wills hasn't adduced a single piece of evidence to rebut this proposition. And that's sufficient to dispose of Wills's McDonnell Douglas claim here. See, e.g., Holmes v. City of Ft. Pierce, 2022 U.S. App. LEXIS 2607, 2022 WL 247976, at *6 (11th Cir. Jan. 27, 2022) (finding that the plaintiff failed to make a prima facie case because the ""alleged comparators did not engage in the same basic misconduct""). [**81]"
Yes	18	"Dr. John Alford testified as an expert for the Defendants on racially polarized voting. He does not dispute that voting in Louisiana is polarized as between Black and White voters; rather, it is his opinion that polarized voting in Louisiana is attributable [**154]  to partisanship, not race. The Court does not credit this opinion as helpful, as it appears to answer a question that Gingles II does not ask and in fact squarely rejects,331 namely, why Black voters in Louisiana are politically cohesive. Further, the Court finds that Dr. Alford's conclusions conflict with the opinions of other experts in this case who employed more robust methodology. Dr. Alford merely looked at the results reported by Dr. Palmer and Dr. Handley and opined that polarized voting ""may be correlated with race, but whatever accounts for the correlation, the differential response of voters of different races to the race of the candidate is not the cause.""332 Not only does this statement appear to concede that Dr. Alford does not know exactly why voting is polarized (""whatever accounts for the correlation""), Dr. Palmer's well-accepted ecological inference analysis contradicts it. Dr. Palmer demonstrated that the race of the candidate does have an effect; he found that Black voters support Black candidates more often in a statistically observable way. The Court finds that Dr. Alford's opinions border on ipse dixit. His opinions are unsupported by meaningful substantive analysis [**155]  and are not the result of commonly accepted methodology in the  [*841]  field. Other courts have found the same.333"
Yes	24	Notably, it is undisputed that the vast majority of Lukoil's workforce is non-Russian; that none of the three managing directors who were in charge during Benzinger's tenure at Lukoil were of Russian descent—Reynolds [**35]  and Rodilosso are American, and Fenner is British; that the sole member of the Lukoil board of directors during that time, Bullock, is British; and that Benzinger was replaced by Charles, an American. Def. 56.1 ¶¶ 59, 61-63. Benzinger does not claim, and the record does not suggest, that anyone made invidious comments or that statistical evidence supports her contentions. In the end, Benzinger is left only with her conclusory allegations that she was treated differently because she was not Russian. Under the totality of the circumstances, no reasonable juror could find that the record raises even a de minimis inference of discrimination. Benzinger's NYSHRL discrimination must fail on this ground, as well.
Yes	7	"To explore a possible cause and effect relationship further study is required. The investigator should then observe the effect on one variable, the dependent variable, of manipulation of another, an independent variable. Id. at 348. Independent variables represent the possible ""causes"" of the ""effect"" being studied. If the study does not contemplate the results of manipulating various independent variables, it does little to prove causation. That is because the real cause of the observed results may be variables other than the one with which the dependent variable is associated. When an association is identified among variables, a controlled experiment will help identify which independent variable caused the effect. In fact, this is the best way to eliminate other variables as possible causes of observed associations. Id. at 347. If a controlled experiment [**31]  is not conducted, then the investigator should at least measure the group in which the effect occurred against a comparable group in which the effect is not expected or observed. See id. at 349. The key to success, however, is that the second group actually be comparable.

The statistics offered by the plaintiffs have only eliminated random chance as a possible explanation for the disparities. See Pls.' Ex. 56, Wertheimer Report at 8, PP 14, 16, 20-22, 28; Defs.' App. 108, Rothman Report at 4; see also EEOC v. Sears Roebuck & Co. 839 F.2d 302, 323 n.20 (7th Cir. 1988) (standard deviation and other measures of statistical [**43]  significance merely attempt to eliminate chance as reason for results, do not prove causation). That method would be valid if it is reasonable to assume that the job skills the defendants needed to retain were equally distributed across age groups. See Barnes, 896 F.2d at 1466. If it is not reasonable so to assume, a defendant can show that the statistical method is faulty, or that chance does explain the discrepancy, and the statistical evidence may lose its effectiveness altogether. Id. at 1469. If it is reasonable, the statistical evidence that shows a greater number of terminations among certain age groups than would be expected due to chance, may state a prima facie case for age discrimination. Id.

Yes	17	"Defendants also challenge Dr. Kriegler's reliance on the 10th and 25th percentiles of respondents, arguing that ""ignor[ing] the vast majority of the data"" does not make his results more reliable. Id. at 13-14. Defendants argue that Dr. Kriegler's attempts to validate his results through reliance on daily itineraries and deposition testimony of players also falls short. Id. at 14-16. For example, they argue that Dr. Kriegler conducted no statistical analysis that attempted to link the itineraries with the survey [**47]  responses at the Club level and that their own expert found ""no statistically significant correlation between the survey responses and the testimony provided by players on the same team."" Id. at 16. Defendants also fault Dr. Kriegler for failing to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals, which they contend is an accepted scientific practice for surveys. Id. at 16-17. Finally, Defendants argue that because Dr. Kriegler relied on the Main Survey, his opinions must be excluded for all the reasons Defendants contend Dr. Dennis's opinions are inadmissible. Id. at 17-18."
Yes	27	The EEOC argues that the September 10, 2008 terminations were discriminatory because black Somali Muslim employees were treated more severely than others, while JBS claims that the evidence is insufficient to make out a prima facie case. The Court finds that the statistical evidence presented, in combination with the other circumstantial evidence (e.g., that Muslim employees' use of unscheduled breaks to pray was targeted for discipline), is sufficient for the Court to infer a pattern or practice of discriminatory discipline on the basis of black race and Muslim religion during Ramadan 2008. See Pitre, 843 F.2d at 1267. The Court, however, finds that the EEOC has not shown a prima facie case that there is a pattern or practice of discrimination on the basis of Somali national origin. The non-statistical circumstantial evidence of prejudice and discrimination was tied to race and religion. While national origin undoubtably played a role in cultural tensions at the Greeley plant in 2008, there was little, if any, evidence linking discipline or harassment in the [**113]  Greeley plant to anything particular to Somali nationals as a protected class apart from their black race or Muslim religion.35 In particular, the Court finds that the weaker statistical correlation between Somali national origin (using the January 1 birth date proxy) indicates that any pattern or practice of discrimination was on account of such employees' other protected characteristics. The statistical evidence shows less of a correlation between Somali nationality and discipline than the other protected characteristics. It is reasonable to inf er based on the circumstantial evidence that, to the extent discrimination occurred, black race and Muslim religion were the basis for any pattern or practice of discrimination, not Somali national origin.
No	45	"Faulkner listed seven men in her complaint who were allegedly similarly situated to [**6]  her but treated more favorably by DCDC. However, the record indicates that six of them were not similarly situated to Faulkner, and one was treated the same. One of the men had no injuries, four were released back to their jobs without medical restrictions, and a sixth was released back to work with no medical restrictions until he retired. The seventh comparator was similarly situated to Faulkner in that he, too, could not perform the duties of a corrections officer, and was terminated. Faulkner therefore did not establish her prima facie case of sex discrimination, and the district court correctly granted summary judgment on her claim.5

No	54	"A plaintiff may satisfy the fourth element of the McDonnell Douglas test by showing that he was replaced by a person from a nonprotected class or that similarly situated nonprotected employees were treated more favorably. Haji v. Columbus City Schs., 621 Fed. Appx. 309, 315 (6th Cir. 2015). Here, Defendant did not hire another person for the position after rescinding Plaintiff's offer. (ECF No. 49-3, PageID #798-99; ECF No. 49-5, PageID #978.) Therefore, Plaintiff must show that similarly situated employees received more favorable treatment. HN20 To establish that an employee is similarly [**36]  situated, Plaintiff must show that the employee is similar to him in ""all relevant respects"" but ""need not demonstrate an exact correlation.""

No	39	"It is undisputed that the first two elements of Plaintiff's disability discrimination claim are satisfied. Nor is it disputed that Plaintiff was subject to an adverse employment decision (i.e., non-selection for the SRER position). Thus, the remaining element of Plaintiff's prima facie case is whether Plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action because of her disability. Plaintiff contends that the causation element of her disability discrimination claim is met because of a ""hiring freeze"" that occurred after she first applied for one of eleven available SRER positions. Doc. No. 28 at 15. Moreover, Plaintiff asserts that Tucker, a white male in his thirties, received multiple promotions, whereas Plaintiff ""spent her last 22 years getting great reviews and no promotions as a field consultant."" Id. Finally, Plaintiff claims that when she disclosed her disability during the interview, Tucker and Opsahl ""were turned off in a way that no other aspect of the interview turned them off."" Id. at 16.
