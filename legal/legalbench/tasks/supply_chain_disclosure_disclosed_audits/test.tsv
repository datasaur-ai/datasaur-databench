Yes	86	"The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) is designed to increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding efforts to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking.

Danaher Corporation believes that workers at supplier facilities have the right to freely choose employment. Danaher further expects that all suppliers who do business with Danaher and its subsidiaries will comply with all applicable laws, including the laws against forced or involuntary labor, and this expectation is embodied in Danaher’s Supplier Code of Conduct (located at www.danaher.com/suppliers). Danaher Corporation is not aware that any of its suppliers engage in human trafficking or slavery and has not received any information suggesting that any of its suppliers engage in human trafficking or slavery. Accordingly, Danaher Corporation does not verify its supply chains to evaluate the risks of human trafficking or slavery, audit its suppliers for compliance with or require suppliers to certify compliance with the laws regarding human trafficking and slavery, provide training relating thereto or maintain internal accountability standards relating thereto apart from the Danaher Standards of Conduct provisions that require Danaher associates to comply with all applicable laws.

This disclosure applies to all consolidated Danaher subsidiaries that are California taxpayers subject to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act."

We are committed to upholding human rights for everyone, including our team members and those of our business partners, by only supporting employment arrangements that adhere to applicable child and voluntary labor laws and minimum wage standards. As a matter of practice, we follow the Electronics Industry Code of Conduct and require the same commitment from applicable suppliers via contractual requirements. We are confident in those suppliers’ ability to be compliant with these requirements due to the manner in which we select and manage our key business partners. Quantum engages with only reputable component suppliers and contract manufacturers, whose suitability as our partner is evaluated prior to selection through appropriate quality and business process audits, business model reviews, and sustainability assessments. Adherence to Quantum’s Supplier Code of Conduct Requirements is validated via internal employee education regarding supply chain risks, regular visits to key supplier facilities and our Quarterly Business Review process. Given the frequency of our visits to key supplier locations and the clear communication of our expectations, we do not currently utilize third parties to conduct independent, unannounced audits of supplier compliance with Quantum’s code of conduct requirements. Any Quantum team members or business partners found to be in violation of Quantum’s code of conduct requirements may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of the employment or business relationship. - See more at: http://www.quantum.com/aboutus/ethicsandcompliance/index.aspx#sthash.Rr2UEWyq.dpuf"

At Bio-Rad our mission is to provide useful and high-quality products and services that advance scientific discovery and improve healthcare. We provide an expansive line of products and services to hospitals, universities, major research institutions, biotechnology companies, and pharmaceutical firms throughout the world.

In keeping with Bio-Rad’s Mission and to comply with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) we are posting this disclosure. The Act requires retailers and manufacturers doing business in California to disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains for tangible goods offered for sale. The Act requires disclosures regarding verification, auditing, certification, internal accountability, and training.

Bio-Rad supports the elimination of slavery and human trafficking.

Verification

Certain of our business units evaluate the risks of human trafficking and slavery in Bio-Rad's product supply chain and also use supply chain processes to mitigate potential risks. Bio-Rad does not employ a third party for verification.

Auditing

Some business units audit their principal suppliers. Bio-Rad continues to evaluate its supply chain processes to consider how it can further support the elimination of slavery and human trafficking.

Supplier Agreements

While Bio-Rad suppliers may have their own codes of business conduct and ethics which require them to comply with applicable laws, our suppliers may also commit contractually to such a standard in their supply contracts with us or when they accept Bio-Rad’s purchase order terms and conditions. Some Bio-Rad business units also engage their principal suppliers in supplier awareness training concerning slavery and human trafficking during periodic supplier day events.

Internal Accountability

Bio-Rad has a Code of Business Ethics and Conduct which applies to Bio-Rad’s employees worldwide and to Bio-Rad’s Board of Directors. The Code requires employees to comply with applicable law and transact business in a lawful, honest, ethical, and professional manner. Employees are also required to treat customers, suppliers, employees, governments and the public with respect, honesty, and integrity. In particular, the Code states that regulators have a “zero tolerance” policy with respect to acts that support the trafficking of persons or the use of forced labor. If an employee needs guidance or knows of or suspects a violation of the Code, the Code requires that he or she consult with or report the matter to his or her supervisor, management or Human Resources. Those employees who violate the Code are subject to appropriate corrective action, which can include disciplinary measures permitted by applicable law, such as dismissal, and possible legal proceedings.

Procurement Training

All Bio-Rad employees receive periodic training on the Code of Business Ethics and Conduct. In addition, some Bio-Rad business units provide periodic training to employees responsible for procurement of materials for Bio-Rad’s product supply chain and have undertaken to familiarize their buyers with identifying slavery and human trafficking issues and mitigating such risks. One of the questions that procurement personnel may consider when selecting a supplier relates to slavery and human trafficking.

For purposes of this Statement, the term “Bio-Rad” and such terms as “our,” and “we” may refer to one or more or all of Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.’s consolidated subsidiaries. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise designation of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (the “Act”) requires certain companies doing business in California to disclose information regarding their efforts to address the risk of slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. Newport Corporation (“Newport”) is committed to conducting business ethically and in compliance with global labor and human rights laws, and we expect the same of our suppliers. Newport maintains a Supplier Code of Conduct (the “Code of Conduct”), and by conducting business with Newport, Suppliers agree to adhere to the requirements of the Code of Conduct, which include prohibitions on forced labor, human trafficking and child labor, and require compliance with wage and hour laws and humane treatment, non-discrimination and freedom of association of employees.

Statement Under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657)

PVH Corp., one of the world's largest apparel companies, owns and markets the iconic Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands worldwide. We are the world's largest shirt and neckwear company and market a variety of goods under our own brands, Van Heusen, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, IZOD, ARROW, Speedo†, Olga and Warner's, as well as numerous nationally and internationally known brands we license from third parties.

Central to our identity is a genuine commitment to corporate social responsibility - CSR. For over 100 years, our credo has been to conduct all business in keeping with the highest moral, ethical and legal standards. CSR is a fundamental component of how we run our business and is directly linked to our strategies and practices. We continually move toward increased transparency and accountability to the public and report on our CSR efforts, performance and vision for the future. We invite you to visit our online CSR report at pvhcsr.com to learn more.

We were one of the first companies to publish a code of conduct regarding workers rights and working conditions when our A Shared Commitment (PDF) was initially published in 1991. Our commitment to our workers and workers in our supply chain was further evidenced when we became a founding member of the Apparel Industry Partnership in 1996, which has been succeeded by the Fair Labor Association (""FLA""), of which we continue to be a member in good standing. In taking this leadership role and making this commitment to human rights and compliance with labor laws, we have aligned the requirements for doing business with us with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Labor Organization's (""ILO"") Core Conventions and the United Nations Framework on Business and Human Rights. More directly, the FLA has an accreditation program that is an independent external verification of each member's human rights program's compliance with the FLA's Workplace Code of Conduct. The FLA's Workplace Code of Conduct is a global set of principles based on the ILO's standards for working conditions in factories. Accreditation takes place every three years and we have been accredited by the FLA since 2005. 

It is within this framework that we make this statement under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657), which requires us to disclose our efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our direct supply chain for the products we sell.

How we assess the risk of human trafficking and slavery in our product supply chain. We source and purchase substantially all of the products sold by our wholesale and retail businesses. Suppliers of these products must agree to our A Shared Commitment code of conduct requirements, disclose all factories intended for production of our goods, and submit to compliance audits. The audits, which are typically conducted by members of our Global Human Rights and Social Responsibility Department but may also be conducted by reputable third party auditors identified and managed by the Department, necessarily include investigation of terms and conditions of employment that are designed to verify the risks and uncover the existence of human trafficking, slavery or other forms of compelled employment and lack of freedom.

How we audit for compliance with our A Shared Commitment code of conduct. We require that all factories intended for production of our goods be audited for compliance with our A Shared Commitment code of conduct prior to the commencement of production. These audits are typically conducted by members of our Global Human Rights and Social Responsibility Department but may also be conducted by reputable third party auditors identified and managed by the Department. All factories are re-audited every 12 - 18 months. Initial audits are typically announced, while follow-up audits are typically unannounced.

We ensure that the vendors used by our suppliers in manufacturing our products comply with our A Shared Commitment code of conduct through auditing; we are implementing a program for our suppliers to certify that the materials used in the manufacturing of our products are produced in compliance with the code. Our A Shared Commitment code of conduct requires our suppliers to ensure that the vendors they use in manufacturing our products comply with the code, including in respect of human trafficking and slavery. Direct suppliers are evaluated for compliance with this aspect of the code though our audits of the suppliers, as well as our audits of their vendors and suppliers. With respect to the materials used in the manufacturing of our products, we are implementing a certification program for our suppliers. Under this program, our suppliers will be required to certify that the materials were produced in compliance with the requirements of the code.

We maintain and rigorously enforce internal accountability procedures for employees and contractors regarding our A Shared Commitment code of conduct, including standards with respect to slavery and human trafficking. Our Human Rights program includes a Sustainable Compliance Initiative for purposes of remediating violations of our Shared Commitment code of conduct that our audits uncover. This permits us to examine the specific situation and develop a best possible strategy for resolution. It also enables us to serve the interests of the workers best by aiding in the development of a safe, legal and respectful workplace. If cases of non-compliance are not resolved, or at least substantially addressed, within a specified time frame, we will terminate the business relationship. With respect to the most egregious cases of code violations, we will terminate the relationship immediately and report the situation to the appropriate authority. This would be the case if we were to uncover a situation involving slavery and human trafficking.

Internally, we have extensive policies, practices and procedures that encompass the requirements of our A Shared Commitment code of conduct and ensure compliance with the standards set forth therein. This includes a constant and vocal commitment of management (starting with our CEO) to the full array of workplace issues; in-house training programs for all associates, as well as additional training for our Human Resources and management teams; reporting hotlines; audits of facilities we acquire; and safeguards in the workplace and hiring process that also serve the purpose of enabling us to identify violations, including human trafficking and slavery, were they to occur. It is clear that our commitment to human rights standards would result in the severest discipline on any employee or contractor who engaged in, facilitated or allowed forced labor, human trafficking or slavery to exist in any of our own facilities.

We conduct training on our A Shared Commitment code of conduct, including with respect to human trafficking and slavery, with a particular focus on mitigating risks. The associates in our Global Human Rights and Social Responsibility Department and Global Sourcing division are trained on our A Shared Commitment code of conduct, as is management at our suppliers, in order to ensure the necessary participants in supply chain management are knowledgeable and aware of the issues and concerns surrounding the supply chain. Our associates also participate (both as speakers and attendees) in external training programs and seminars on social compliance issues, including on the issues of human trafficking and slavery.

Yes	168	"Kellogg Company has a solid foundation of integrity and respect. This is important because our business success depends on earning the trust of customers and consumers by meeting their needs for nutritious, enjoyable foods that are sourced responsibly.

As a responsible corporate citizen, Kellogg is committed to an ethical and transparent supply chain. One aspect of our responsible sourcing commitment is a zero-tolerance position against forced labor, including slavery and human trafficking.

We believe it is our duty to raise awareness and educate our internal and external stakeholders on this important issue and to take appropriate steps to verify that slavery and human trafficking does not exist within our operations or within our global supply chain. To us, this is a journey that should be made thoughtfully and proactively.

Awareness

Our Global Code of Ethics requires our employees to obey the law, act with integrity, show respect and do business with suppliers who embrace and demonstrate high standards of ethical business behavior. It requires diligence in determining whether suppliers conform to our standards such as no forced labor. Through training and general awareness messages, Kellogg requires procurement and supply chain employees to be informed of the issues surrounding slavery and human trafficking, and to report any and all actual or suspected violations that come to their attention.

Our global Supplier Code of Conduct requires our suppliers to treat their employees with fairness, respect and dignity, and specifically prohibits forced labor, physical coercion, corporal punishment and harassment. We require that our suppliers comply with the expectations and standards of our code, and that their suppliers and subcontractors do the same. We reserve the right to terminate a contract with any supplier, at our sole discretion, for violations of our global Supplier Code of Conduct.

At Kellogg, we have three main categories of suppliers: premium, direct, and indirect. Premium suppliers provide Kellogg with the small gifts and prizes we occassionally include with our products. Direct suppliers provide Kellogg with raw materials, ingredients and packaging. Indirect suppliers provide Kellogg with everything else that supports our business like consulting, travel, marketing services, etc. In 2009, we developed and deployed our global Supplier Code of Conduct. By 2010, 99% of our direct suppliers had accepted our global Supplier Code of Conduct. To date, 100% of our premium suppliers and 99% of our critical indirect suppliers have also accepted our global Supplier Code of Conduct.

We have embedded our global Supplier Code of Conduct in our contracts and purchase order terms and conditions in Kellogg North America and intend to do the same globally.

In the upcoming revision to our global Supplier Code of Conduct, we will make specific reference to human trafficking as a prohibited supplier activity.

Education

Since 2010, Kellogg has used our various supplier meetings to educate our suppliers on our expectations regarding our global Supplier Code of Conduct. As part of these discussions, we have addressed the important issues of slavery and human trafficking. Fortunately, we have not found instances of forced labor in our supply chain, but we want our suppliers to know that this is a critical issue for Kellogg.

Along with having industry and internal experts discuss the issue of slavery and human trafficking with select employees, in 2011 we required U.S. and Canadian employees in our Supply Chain, and those in our Procurement and Quality organizations who have direct and substantive interaction with our supply chain, to complete an online course on eliminating forced labor, slavery and human trafficking from the global supply chain. This online course will be rolled out globally in 2012.

To ensure alignment within our industry, Kellogg is a long-standing member of AIM PROGRESS, a forum of consumer goods companies assembled to enable and promote responsible sourcing practices and sustainable production systems. AIM PROGRESS is a global initiative supported and sponsored by AIM in Europe and the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA) in North America.

Verification

In 2005, an internal risk assessment determined that premium suppliers were our highest risk supplier group. In response to that determination, we have conducted ethical sourcing audits on premium suppliers within a certain risk profile since 2006. Our audit approach for premium suppliers calls for both third-party and company audits, both announced and when necessary unannounced.

In 2012, we will conduct an internal supplier risk assessment focused on high-risk commodities and high-risk countries to determine high-risk suppliers among our direct and indirect supplier groups and develop an appropriate ethical sourcing audit approach."

Yes	143	"CA Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect. This law seeks to increase the quantity of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts, if any, to address the issues of slavery and human trafficking in their supply chains. This in turn allows consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support. 

HP's Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct includes provisions that address international labor and human rights standards. HP requires its suppliers to agree to conform to the standards contained in the HP EICC Code of Conduct ensuring workers at supplier facilities have: (i) the right to freely choose employment; (ii) the right, in accordance with local laws, to associate freely, join or be represented by worker councils, join labor unions on a voluntary basis, and bargain collectively as they choose; and (iii) the right to a workplace free of harassment and unlawful discrimination. HP's Global Human Rights Policy further outlines HP's commitment to and respect for human rights.  Additionally, HP introduced guidance for the treatment of student and dispatch workers in China in 2013.

HP is aware that slavery and human trafficking can take many forms, including forced labor and child labor. Since HP began its Supply Chain Responsibility program in 2000, HP has undertaken efforts to ensure and verify there is no slavery or human trafficking of any form in its supply chain. These efforts include:

Evaluation and verification of product supply chains. HP evaluates the risk of slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain through risk-based supplier assessments and supply chain due diligence. 

Risk-based supplier assessments. HP performs assessments of potential suppliers according to HP's risk-based approach. This approach includes preliminary risk assessments, supplier assessment questionnaires, and specialized onboarding assessments.

Due diligence. HP's Supplier Performance Management (SPM) scorecard is one method HP uses for measurement and tracking. The Scorecard is used to periodically assess supplier performance throughout the year and covers performance on issues such as regular business requirements—including compliance, legislation, and product quality—and social, ethical, and environmental considerations. In 2013, HP updated HP’s procurement scoring process to place greater emphasis on SER performance in the business award process. (See “Procurement integration” on page 2 of Our approach for more information.)   


HP also verifies the absence of slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain through the use of comprehensive and specialized audits as described in Part 2, ""Audits of suppliers,"" below.

Audits of suppliers. HP's audit program evaluates and verifies suppliers' compliance with HP's EICC Code of Conduct, which, among other things, prohibits both forced and child labor. With few exceptions, audit verification is substantiated by at least three different, independent sources of evidence including documents, records, management interviews, worker interviews, and physical observations. Various types of announced assessments are conducted under this program, including comprehensive on-site audits attended by HP, collaborative audits, and third-party on-site audits of supplier practices and underlying management systems. In addition to comprehensive audits, HP uses specialized assessments to engage on issues or questions specific to individual suppliers that are identified through the comprehensive audits, our Key Performance Indicator (KPI) program, and external stakeholder feedback. A finding of nonconformance with HP's EICC Code of Conduct relating to the issue of forced or child labor does not necessarily indicate that forced or child labor has occurred, but could indicate a lack of systemic processes or procedures to prevent such an occurrence. Following an audit and finding of nonconformance, suppliers are required to produce corrective action plans to outline how they intend to resolve the issues, which HP then reviews and approves. HP has a zero-tolerance policy for the presence of forced and child labor. If any zero-tolerance items are uncovered in audits, HP requires suppliers to rectify these items no later than 30 days after the original audit. HP then reexamines the zero-tolerance item between 30 and 90 days after the audit with an in-person visual verification to confirm resolution of the issue.  80% of HP's suppliers audited in 2012 and 2013 confirmed that HP's EICC Code of Conduct requirements were communicated to their next tier suppliers. Approximately 65% of HP's suppliers also demonstrated that they had implemented an effective process to ensure that their respective next tier suppliers implement HP's EICC Code of Conduct. (See page 6 of Our approach for more information on our audit strategy.) 
 

Certification requirements for direct suppliers. HP has purchasing agreements or purchase order terms and conditions in place with our direct suppliers and Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs), requiring each to comply with international standards and applicable laws and regulations regarding forced and child labor as specified in HP's EICC Code of Conduct. HP's direct suppliers and ODMs certify that their operations comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking through their assent to the terms and conditions regarding the same in these HP agreements. Although the terms of the HP’s EICC Code of Conduct do not specifically address ""materials"" that suppliers incorporate into products, HP presents the Code of Conduct as a total supply chain initiative and requires suppliers and ODMs to certify, at minimum, that they require their next tier suppliers to comply, including compliance with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. 

Internal accountability standards and procedures. HP requires all of its employees and contractors to comply with HP's Standards of Business Conduct (SBC), which includes provisions aimed to ensure that bonded, child, forced, indentured, or involuntary prison labor are not permitted or enabled by any HP business partner or within supplier operations. HP's SBC is enforced through the HP Global Misconduct Policy which includes procedures for employees who fail to meet these standards, and we train employees on these standards annually. HP's SBC has also been adapted for contingent workers in the HP Contingent Worker Code of Conduct, which is re-enforced through labor contracts.
 

Employee training. HP trains employees responsible for supply chain management on how to identify and respond to supply chain issues, such as forced labor or child labor through HP's procurement training program. The program explains the definition, purpose, and enforcement of HP standards against forced and child labor as well as how to mitigate the risks within the supply chains of products. HP also partners with a number of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and training partners to raise awareness of and conformance to HP's EICC Code of Conduct through various programs. Among other things, these programs look to improve supplier capabilities to comply with HP's EICC Code of Conduct and reduce the risk of nonconformance. HP's supply chain capability building programs have included worker-management communications training, which provides employees access to mechanisms to raise any issues with management or superiors. Since 2008, HP has partnered with labor NGOs to provide training on HP’s EICC Code of Conduct, as well as an independent direct hotline for workers in China, to increase workers' knowledge of labor rights. Since 2011, HP has conducted two training sessions with a total of 39 suppliers in Malaysia and Singapore on best practices for employing foreign migrant workers. The trainings were based on guidance developed in partnership with Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) through the International Labor Migration working group. Key HP suppliers as well as their respective sub-tier suppliers attended these sessions.  

In addition to the efforts described above, minerals mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo which may have directly or indirectly benefitted armed groups engaged in human rights violations is another area of concern for the industry. HP has been a leader in conducting due diligence of its supply chain, publishing a list of smelters of these minerals which were identified as being in the supply chain for HP products and being a leader in advancing industry programs and tools that enable companies to source conflict free minerals. (See Conflict minerals for more information.)

As an EICC member, HP benefits from the opportunity to participate in the identification and sharing of best practices to combat slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain with other EICC members. This includes evaluation of the EICC Code of Conduct and development of tools and training to help build the capability of EICC suppliers. Other collaborative alliances with Social Accountability International (SAI) and the Global Social Compliance Programme (GSCP) allow HP to exchange information on issues and best practices.
