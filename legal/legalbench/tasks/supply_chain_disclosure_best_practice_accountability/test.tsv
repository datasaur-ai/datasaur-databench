No	377	"Ultratech expects its direct suppliers and supply chain to meet the minimum required global principles of human rights that include; abolition of forced labor, elimination of child labor, equality and anti-discrimination rights, freedom of association, payment of minimum wages, and provision of legally mandated employee benefits.

Ultratech expects that suppliers and their supply chains adhere to these standards, as well as compliance with their own local and national level statutory requirements.  Ultratech uses a variety of techniques in determining (1) Supplier selection, (2) Contractual supplier requirements and (3) Supplier review and ratings.

Sourcing & Supplier Selection

Evaluations normally include supplier visits and/or supplier quality audits of the supplier’s people, processes and capabilities against pre-determined evaluation criteria. During the course of these assessments, the team qualifies how well the supplier meets Ultratech’s standards. Only the suppliers that meet Ultratech’s standards and that optimize or meet the overall selection criteria are selected. Those suppliers then become part of Ultratech’s supply base and are, as appropriate, managed for continuous improvement.  Ultratech employees, instead of a 3rd party, directly use a variety of methods to evaluate and address many potential supply chain risks, including that of human trafficking and slavery.

Contractual Supplier Requirements 
Purchase Order Terms and Conditions: As a condition of doing business and as a means of self-certification, our purchase order standard terms and conditions stipulate that “Seller warrants that it complies with all applicable laws related to slavery, human trafficking and child labor in the countries in which it does business and that it requires producers of goods and materials used in products sold to Buyer to comply with laws related to slavery, human trafficking and child labor in the countries in which they do business..”

Supplier Review and Ratings: 
Key Ultratech suppliers, as appropriate, participate in the Ultratech Supplier Evaluation program. The evaluation includes several qualitative and quantitative measurement criteria.  Ultratech works with suppliers to ensure compliance with Ultratech policies.   The Supplier Management program includes planned business reviews, site visits, and performance audits that include adherence to human rights policies. Site visits and performance-related audits occur when and if a supplier’s scorecard performance is declining and/or if supplier risk is determined through the course of normal supplier visits.  Ultratech employees, evaluate supplier compliance with company policies including human trafficking and slavery through multiple means including possible on-site audits, some of which may be unannounced.  These audits are performed directly by Ultratech, instead of relying upon Third party auditors.

Ultratech provides training to company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply-chain management including the review and mitigation of possible human trafficking and slavery."

Yes	253	"Disclosure of the Company pursuant to The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010:

Through the use of a third party verification service, the Company conducts a verification of its direct supply chain. That verification includes, but is not limited to, evaluating and addressing compliance by the direct suppliers with the laws of the country in which they operate, including, but not limited to, applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.

The Company conducts regular audits at selected suppliers on an announced and unannounced basis through the use of a third party verification service which verification includes, but is not limited to, evaluating and addressing compliance by the direct suppliers with the laws of the country in which they operate, including, but not limited to, applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.

The Company strives to continuously improve and enhance the scope of its supply chain management efforts and has developed the Rite Aid Ethical Sourcing Principles for its suppliers which outline the ethical principles and commitments we expect of our suppliers concerning social responsibility. Through these principles, we ask our suppliers to develop and implement appropriate mechanisms to promote them internally and within their supply chain. That is the extent to which we ask our suppliers to certify that the materials incorporated into their products are produced in accordance with the laws of the country in which they operate, including, but not limited to, applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking.

A commitment by our direct suppliers to comply with the laws of the country in which they operate, including, but not limited to, applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking, is expected to maintain good standing as a supplier to the Company. However, due to the current practical limitations on verification beyond the first tier in a supply chain, the Company’s verification process is limited to first tier suppliers. As part of the Company’s efforts to continuously improve and enhance its supply chain management systems, the Company expects to conduct annual training for those employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management. Such training is expected to include, but not be limited to ensuring supplier compliance with the laws of the country in which they operate, including, but not limited to, applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. The Company expects any

person who observes or becomes aware of the existence of slavery or human trafficking in the supply chain to report it to the approprate authorities."

Bridgford Foods Corporation is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen, and to actively engaging and promoting socially responsible and ethical business practices. This commitment extends to our supply chain, and we work with our suppliers to ensure that together we manage our business and business relationships in a socially responsible and ethical way. 

Effective January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires Bridgford Foods to disclose our efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our supply chain. Bridgford combats human trafficking on two fronts: first, by holding our suppliers to a high standard of accountability; and second, by ensuring our own employees are made aware of the problem of human trafficking, and providing them with relevant training about the problem of human trafficking. Bridgford is committed to conducting its business in a lawful and ethical manner, and therefore expects both its suppliers and employees to comport themselves in the same manner. 

Bridgford has long required compliance with applicable labor and employment laws, including those that address the illegality of human trafficking and slavery. Now, we are taking steps to verify such compliance from our suppliers. To evaluate and address the risks of human trafficking and slavery specific to each link in our supply chain, and verify that our suppliers are combating human trafficking, Bridgford Foods utilizes a Supplier Code of Conduct, which prohibits all types of illegal conduct by our suppliers including unlawful discrimination and harassment as well as human trafficking and slavery.  The Code of Conduct makes clear Bridgford Foods’ commitment to eradicating human trafficking. Bridgford Foods requires each and every supplier to accept the Supplier Code of Conduct, and to sign an acknowledgement of receipt of the Code. 

To evaluate supplier compliance with our Supplier Code, particularly with the provisions that prohibit human trafficking and slavery, Bridgford Foods has obtained the authority to conduct unannounced audits of its suppliers to ensure their compliance with the Code of Conduct. If Bridgford ever receives a Complaint or other constructive knowledge of an allegation of human trafficking or slavery, it requires the supplier to perform a thorough and complete investigation and report the results of the investigation to Bridgford. Additionally, Bridgford Foods requires that suppliers certify that all materials incorporated into their products abide by applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. 

Moreover, Bridgford Foods has a corporate Human Rights Policy. This policy further advances our goal of remaining socially responsible, while at the same time maintaining an accountability standard to which we hold our employees. As our policy states, we have zero tolerance for human trafficking and slavery. This policy is distributed to, and applicable to, all employees. 

To make sure our employees have the requisite knowledge to aid in our efforts to eradicate human trafficking, Bridgford Foods makes available to all our employees various training and information addressing human rights, including the human trafficking training offered by the Department of Homeland Security. All employees are encouraged to avail themselves of these trainings and opportunities. 

Bridgford Foods is committed to working closely with its suppliers and others to raise awareness of and eradicate slavery and human trafficking. We remain vigilant on this issue, and, if necessary, will hold any offending supplier accountable for its violation of our policies and the law."

Yes	143	"Supply Chain and Conflict-Free Minerals

Background
“Conflict minerals” – tantalum, tin, gold, or tungsten – that originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) or adjoining countries are sometimes mined and sold by armed groups to finance civil violence. These minerals can make their way into the supply chains of products used by consumers and businesses around the world.

In 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which requires U.S. Securities and Exchange Act reporting companies, such as Illumina, to disclose their use of such conflict minerals beginning in 2014.

Conflict-Free Minerals Policy
Illumina supports the goal of avoiding the use of conflict minerals that directly or indirectly benefit armed groups in the DRC or adjoining countries.

Accordingly, Illumina expects its suppliers to commit to the EICC Code of Conduct, which was established by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) to ensure worker safety and fairness, environmental responsibility, and business efficiency. The EICC Code of Conduct includes a provision related to the responsible sourcing of minerals and requires suppliers to have a policy to reasonably assure that the tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold in the products they manufacture does not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups that are perpetrators of serious human rights abuses in the DRC or an adjoining country. Illumina expects its suppliers to establish their own due diligence program to ensure supply chains that are free of conflict minerals and to make their due diligence measures available to Illumina upon request.

Illumina will routinely evaluate its suppliers to ensure that they are adhering to Illumina’s expectations and values."

In accordance with this State act, the following information is provided regarding our efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from our direct supply chain. 

As part of the our supplier Code of Conduct, our suppliers certify that materials incorporated into our products comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

As part of regularly scheduled internal quality assurance audits, we ensure that suppliers have received and understand the Code of Conduct and we review the extent of controls they have in place to ensure compliance with company standards for human trafficking and slavery, but at this time we do not commission third party, independent, unannounced audits or verifications of our supply chain to evaluate and address the risk of human trafficking and slavery or to evaluate compliance with company standards for human trafficking and slavery.

We maintain internal accountability standards and procedures for our employees and contractors who fail to meet company standards regarding slavery and human trafficking.

We do not currently provide company employees and management with direct responsibility for supply chain management formal training on human trafficking and slavery as we believe mitigating associated risks is attained through our supplier guarantees and periodic quality assurance audits."
