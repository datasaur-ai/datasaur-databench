Docket No.	answer	index	question
21-476	Clarification	68	What do you call it?
21-476	Clarification	134	Well, back to my black Santa example, suppose it's a state that defines a public accomodation -- prohibits a public accommodation to discriminate on the basis of political ideology. So then -- then the picture has to be taken?
21-908	Implications	288	Ms. Ross, could you just comment? You heard the various hypotheticals about trying to find a limit to your -- to Respondent's theory that you apparently share. Would you spend a few minutes on that, what the limit is?
21-476	Criticism	201	So I will -- I will write a press release for many faiths and many belief systems that are -- but they have to be consistent with mine and I won't do it if it -- if it offends my religious faith. Good to go?
21-376	Background	38	Would you spend a minute on what the good cause standard is? I think -- of course, you understand that there's already a placement, there's already adoption in process, but how does that work?
21-476	Implications	249	who's making an expression here?
22-506	Background	0	Just briefly. There's some discussion in the briefs that going past with this provision or that modification or waiver, that this is, in effect, a cancellation of a debt -- that's really what we're talking about -- and that as a cancellation of $400 billion in debt, in effect, this is a grant of $400 billion, and it runs head long into Congress's appropriations authority, and I'd like to give you some time to respond to that.
21-476	Clarification	61	And you protect religious beliefs under the statute, right?
21-1484	Background	26	Can I ask you if -- are you bringing this lawsuit under the Tucker Act?
21-376	Background	33	I mean, General Stone, it would profit us that if you would address your standing in this case, particularly since it seems that, to the extent that you're representing parents or potential parents, they can represent themselves, and I think it would be good to get an explanation of your standing.
