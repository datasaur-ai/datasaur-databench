No	377	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657)
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (SB 657) requires many companies, including Western Digital, to disclose on their websites the efforts they take to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their direct supply chains.  SB 657 requires disclosures regarding verification, auditing, certification, internal accountability and training.

1.  Supply Chain Verification and Auditing 
Western Digital’s commitment to global citizenship is strengthened by its commitment to the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) and its adherence to the EICC Code of Conduct.  This Code of Conduct addresses supply chain performance expectations for labor, health and safety, environmental practices, ethics and management systems.  
 
Western Digital requires that its suppliers make a commitment to adhering to the EICC Code of Conduct and requires that suppliers perform periodic self-assessments.  Western Digital also performs periodic audits of key suppliers.  These audits are coordinated with these suppliers.  While Western Digital does not engage third parties to conduct these audits, some suppliers have been audited by third parties retained by other EICC member companies.

We believe that our suppliers' compliance with the EICC code reduces the risks of human trafficking and slavery in our supply chain. Western Digital and its subsidiaries expect suppliers to comply with the EICC code regardless of local business practices or social customs, and as may be requested by Western Digital, to demonstrate adherence to those codes. 

For more information on the EICC and to view the EICC Code of Conduct, visit http://www.eicc.info/. 

2.  Compliance with Slavery and Human Trafficking Laws
Suppliers contracted to Western Digital are required to comply with all laws applicable to their business operations.  Suppliers are also required to make a commitment to the EICC Code of Conduct.

3.  Internal Accountability 
Western Digital requires employees to follow its Global Code of Conduct and Code of Business Ethics.  Violations of the Code of Conduct or Code of Business Ethics may be the grounds for employee discipline, up to and including termination of employment.  Contractors are also expected to conduct themselves in a manner consisted with these principles.  Contractors who fail to comply may be dropped from Western Digital’s supply chain.

4.  Training 
Western Digital provides managers and its employees who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with knowledge and information regarding Western Digital’s requirements, including EICC compliance.  Western Digital also regularly conducts training for suppliers on EICC related issues.

Other Supply Chain Initiatives 

Western Digital Corporation is working with its suppliers to support participation in the EICC Carbon reporting system survey.

We also work with business partners to prepare them for early ISO 14064 Certification and have partnered with local universities to further this goal."

The Home Depot, its affiliates, divisions, and subsidiaries strive to conduct business in a responsible manner. As we expand our business activities and work with suppliers domestically and globally to meet customers’ needs, it is important to preserve our collective commitment to human rights and safety in the workplace. 

The Home Depot expects that all suppliers will abide by all applicable international and local laws, rules and regulations in the manufacture and distribution of merchandise or services provided to The Home Depot. All suppliers are strongly encouraged to exceed The Home Depot’s guidelines and promote continuous improvement throughout their operations. 

On January 1, 2012, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) went into effect in the State of California. This law is designed to increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts (if any) to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking, thereby allowing consumers to make better, more informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support. 

Since 2005, The Home Depot has had a set of Social and Environmental Responsibility (SER) Standards which all suppliers are obligated to comply with by contract. Specifically our standards state the following for “Forced Labor”:

“Suppliers will not use of any form of involuntary labor including forced, prison, indentured, bonded, slave, or human trafficked labor.” 

We also actively monitor child labor in our supply chain which can be associated with slavery and human trafficking:

“Suppliers must not employ workers younger than the greater of 15 years of age -- or 14 where the local law allows such an exception consistent with International Labor Organization guidelines -- or the age for completing compulsory education or the minimum age established by law in the country of manufacture. In addition, Suppliers must comply with all local legal requirements for the work of authorized young workers, particularly those pertaining to hours of work, wages, and working conditions.”

The Home Depot utilizes internal staff as well as a number of third-party social responsibility firms to monitor and prevent human rights abuse in our supply chain.

Our efforts include:

Supply Chain Verification 
In addition to the contractual obligations outlined above, The Home Depot performs factory assessments (Audits) of suppliers of private brand and direct import products on a periodic basis. Every factory receives an Audit at least every two (2) years. The majority of our factories receive a new Audit every six (6) months to one (1) year, while those achieving a 95% score or better receive a new audit less frequently. These assessments are conducted by trained individuals from our internal SER team as well as our third-party social responsibility firm partners. Notably, almost a quarter of the questions used in these Audits focuses on the risks associated with the various types of forced and child labor and other national laws associated with them.

Supplier Audits 
The Home Depot evaluates and verifies suppliers’ compliance with our SER Standards via on-site auditing. As described above, we audit all factories manufacturing private brand and direct import products while contractually holding our national brand partners to the same level of due diligence. Announced audits are conducted prior to placing any purchase orders with a private brand or direct import supplier. We also utilize pre-source assessments, specific response Audits when we are directly made aware of an issue by any source, and a comprehensive risk based re-audit program, which include both announced and unannounced audits, to ensure these factories are monitored on a continuous basis. At the conclusion of every Audit where an issue of noncompliance is found, a Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) plan is created with firm timelines based on the level of risk (High 30 days, Medium 90 days). The Home Depot has a policy of verifying the CAPA implementation to confirm that the factories are meeting the commitments set forth in the CAPA plan. Evidence of forced or child labor during any of the aforementioned discovery methods is deemed a “Critical Deficiency” and results in a multi-step engagement between The Home Depot and the supplier. This engagement consists of three (3) visits to the factory over a six (6) month period. At the completion of this engagement, a new Audit is required and the factory must demonstrate systemic improvements or risk termination by The Home Depot.

Supplier Certifications 
The Home Depot has a Supplier Buying Agreement in place with our suppliers requiring them to comply with international standards and applicable laws and regulations, including those related to forced labor and child labor as specified in The Home Depot’s SER Standards. In the event of a non-compliant supplier or factory, we work with our suppliers on remediation efforts. Notwithstanding the above, we have a termination mechanism in place which defines the circumstances under which a factory or supplier will be excluded from conducting future business with The Home Depot.

Internal Accountability
We believe in Respect for All People and Doing the Right Thing, which are emphasized to all associates as part of our values wheel. To help enforce our values, The Home Depot has an anonymous hotline available to our associates for the purposes of reporting violations of company policy or legal requirements. This resource is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and each report is investigated by our corporate compliance team.

Training 
The Home Depot trains internal employees responsible for sourcing products on how to identify and respond to social and environmental responsibility issues, such as forced labor or child labor."
No	253	"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (the “Act”, effective January 1, 2012)

Under the Act, manufacturers and retailers doing business in California are required to provide information on their efforts (if any) to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking.

Commercial Metals Company (“CMC”) does business in California through its subsidiary CMC Steel Fabricators, Inc. that operates several rebar fabrication facilities. While CMC does not have a policy directly addressing slavery and human trafficking, CMC finds slavery and human trafficking deplorable. This includes the use of forced labor and child labor. CMC prohibits its subsidiaries from using force labor or from hiring children in violation of local laws.

CMC’s processed and finished products come from CMC-owned mills and plants. We comply with international, federal, and state laws regarding labor and employment, including anti-slavery and child labor laws. The raw materials that go into our processed and finished products originate from our recycling yards and various other vendors and suppliers, including scrap from industrial businesses and small, family-owned vendors. To the extent possible, we require our suppliers and vendors to comply with all local laws, regulations, and rules."

Deckers uses many tools and processes designed to ensure that the factories which manufacture its products are fair and safe places for workers. Deckers includes its Ethical Supply Chain (ESC) Code of Conduct as part of its Manufacturing Agreement that it has with each factory. Deckers designed its ESC program in 2008 to help ensure that workers in the factories that manufacture its products are treated ethically and work in safe conditions, and to verify that its product supply chain, including the factories which manufacture its products, conform to fair labor standards, which of course preclude slavery and human trafficking. Deckers uses an internal audit team to regularly assess its factories’ compliance with our fair labor standards. Deckers monitors labor practices as part of the human rights portion of its factory audits (both announced and unannounced). Results from the audit are tallied into a scorecard that is reviewed with each supplier.

Deckers uses its Supplier Code of Conduct to communicate its expectations about how factories and their suppliers should conduct themselves as it relates to fair labor standards, which includes ensuring that their use of materials incorporated into the company’s products comply with laws of the country or countries in which they are doing business. Deckers’ Supplier Code of Conduct can be found here. In the event that an employee or contractor fails to meet Deckers’ internal accountability standards and procedures for fair labor standards, Deckers’ corrective action process is used to develop a remediation plan. Deckers also provides ESC training to its supply chain partners at least once per year. Deckers employees are informed about its ESC program and issues through its Business Ethics Code of Conduct which is sent to all employees."
No	213	"Company Disclosure Statement Pursuant to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires retailers and manufacturers that do business in California to publicly disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains.

Alere supports the rights of all individuals to be free from slavery in the workplace. Alere abhors the practice of human trafficking and slavery and applauds efforts being made globally to eliminate this practice. When entering into written contracts with its suppliers, Alere policy is to include in those contracts a requirement that they comply with laws applicable to the business being transacted, which include laws prohibiting slavery and human trafficking. By signing our contracts our suppliers certify that they conduct their business in compliance with all applicable laws, including but not limited to laws that prohibit slavery and human trafficking. A supplier's failure to honor its legal and contractual obligations to Alere would be a violation of law and a breach of contract. Alere endeavors to do business with reputable suppliers with proper business standards. Alere does not believe that additional verifications or independent audits are necessary to ensure that its suppliers comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business."
No	241	"Campbell Soup Company Disclosure Statement on Human Trafficking and Slavery in the Supply Chain

Campbell is committed to conducting business in compliance with the law and in accordance with the highest ethical standards. Our employees know that they are expected to honor the Company’s commitment to integrity at all times, everywhere in the world. We also recognize that our suppliers and other business partners play a critical role in helping us execute this mission and fulfill our commitment to sustainability in an ethical and responsible manner.

Campbell’s Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual, which is published on our public website, www.campbellsoupcompany.com, identifies our requirements and expectations of all firms that are or aspire to be Campbell suppliers. A firm’s adherence to and performance of these expectations are factors central to our decision whether to enter into or extend existing business relationships. Our suppliers are required to manifest their commitment to the requirements and expectations set forth in the Manual as part of our purchase order and contract process.

The most recent edition of the Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual includes expanded expectations with respect to employee health and safety, environmental performance, and human rights. Among other things, our requirements and expectations specifically address:

		Minimum Employment Age 

		Voluntary Labor 

		Discrimination 

		Wages and Benefits 

		Health and Safety 

		Working Hours and Rest 

		Freedom of Association 

		Fair Treatment 

We are also currently working with industry partners and strategic suppliers to strengthen standards and performance with respect to expectations for ethical sourcing.

We regularly communicate our performance expectations to our suppliers, and include discussions of our corporate responsibility requirements in top-level meetings with a range of ingredient and packaging suppliers. We also promote awareness by discussing our Supply Chain expectations in our corporate social responsibility report, disclosing our expectations on our public website, and referencing them in contracts.

Campbell representatives participate actively in roundtables, panels and industry commissions on the subject of ethical sourcing. We also benchmark to identify best practices and regularly share our best practices with our suppliers, other companies, and other stakeholders who can adopt them.

Our approach to supplier social responsibility is based on strong relationships and continuous improvement. While we use third parties to audit and assess the performance of our suppliers, those

assessment methodologies do not currently include detailed assessments for human trafficking and slavery. We plan to investigate ways to strengthen those assessments in 2012. If we identify suppliers that do not meet our expectations in this area, we will work with them, or direct corrective action plans, to eliminate deficiencies and drive long-term improvements in performance. We will not continue to do business with a supplier that does not take meaningful steps to correct identified shortfalls in its performance.

Campbell provides comprehensive training for all of its employees on the Company’s core expectations with respect to ethics and compliance. As part of our “Winning With Integrity” program, employees are required to complete annual training focused on Campbell’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. This training is available online or in person, and is offered in 13 languages. We also provide “risk-based” training that is tailored to individuals' roles in the Company, and have conducted specific awareness training on the issue of slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain with members of our Procurement organization and Campbell ingredient buyers. In 2012, we will evaluate ways to expand training on slavery and human trafficking, including training on mitigating related risks in supply chains, to employees and executives with direct responsibility for supply chain management.

Yes	168	"We actively pursue growth through leadership in environmental, socially responsible and ethical business practices. Corporate social responsibility is core to our operating philosophy, and that commitment drives our dedication to People, Products, Community and the Planet. That commitment extends to our supply chain, and our suppliers play a critical role in ensuring that we manage our business in a responsible manner.

In 2010, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act (also referred to as SB 657) was signed into law, and statutes enacted under the Act went into effect on January 1, 2012. The Act requires disclosure of particular efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking.

We are committed to conducting its business in a lawful and ethical manner and expect our suppliers to conduct themselves in the same manner. We have implemented various policies and procedures in our efforts to prevent slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains. This disclosure will describe some of those efforts.
With the assistance of a third-party consultant, we survey our merchandise supply chains in order to evaluate and to address risks of slavery and human trafficking inherent in those activities. This survey forms the basis for additional anti-slavery, anti-human trafficking efforts, including targeted supplier requirements and third-party audits.

We have long used contractual provisions prohibiting the use of involuntary labor and child labor, and requiring compliance with applicable labor and employment laws, in the production of merchandise that we sell. We have a stringent Supplier Code of Conduct (“Code”) that sets out specific standards and requirements for any supplier we do business with which includes provisions to protect workers. Among other things, the Code requires our suppliers to allow factory inspections for contractual compliance, as well as for compliance with laws and regulations dealing with child or forced labor and unsafe working conditions.

In our efforts to confirm compliance with such contractual provisions and to document compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, each of our merchandise suppliers has been asked to certify that the materials incorporated into the merchandise they supply complies with applicable laws regarding slavery and human trafficking. Suppliers are also required to ensure that any subcontractor used in the manufacturing or distribution of any merchandise to us complies with the same standards.

Any supplier that is not able to provide the foregoing certification will be required, as a condition to continuing to supply merchandise to us, to submit an action plan to achieve such certification within a reasonable period of time. Those suppliers that fail to comply will be subject to increasing levels of discipline, up to and including termination of their relationships.

In an effort to verify supplier responses and to help us identify areas of increased risk of slavery and human trafficking, we are requiring that our suppliers complete a survey identifying measures they have taken, or intend to take, to prevent these abuses.

We have reviewed the risks of slavery and human trafficking presented by various parts of our supply chain and has inspected the factory premises of the suppliers of our own-branded merchandise for evidence of non-compliance with slavery and human trafficking laws. In addition, we have, on a risk-based basis, engaged third-party auditors to review compliance of certain suppliers with international social accountability standards.

Responsible employees have been advised of our prohibitions against the use of slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains. Additionally, we have implemented training requirements for employees with sourcing responsibilities."
