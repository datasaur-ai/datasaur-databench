C‐TPAT COMPLIANCE

C‐TPAT is a voluntary joint partnership between the Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection (CBP) service, and business (importers, factories, consolidators, customs brokers, carriers, etc.) created in response to the events of September 11, 2001. The goal of this partnership is to provide additional security for both the international supply chain and the U.S. border to ultimately prevent weapons of mass destruction from being stowed in containers destined for U.S. ports

Factories producing products for Whalen are required to comply with all requirements of C‐ TPAT.

.

WHALEN AUDIT PROCESS

Factories will undergo internal Whalen audits, or Whalen customer audits, generally at a time mutually agreed on between the auditing company and the Factory. An audit report will be generated by the auditing company within two weeks of the audit. This report will list any violations to the Whalen or Customer Code of Conduct standard.

The Whalen Global Compliance team will then work with the factory to create a Corrective Action Plan for all violations, and will work with the factory to define steps necessary to correct the violation; identify the individual responsible in the factory to resolve the violation, and to provide a target date when the violation will be resolved. Whalen partner factories are expected to implement these corrective actions within the anticipated time frame and Whalen looks to the factory to continually improve from one audit to the next.

Yes	253	"The Clorox Company

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act Disclosure Statement

The Clorox Company has programs to effectively manage the risks of slavery and trafficking throughout our supply chain.

Our Business Partner Code of Conduct (“Business Partner Code”) addresses business practices of our third-party business partners, including suppliers, distributors, consultants, joint ventures, licensees, and other business partners (“business partners”). Our Business Partner Code contains specific provisions addressing human rights, labor, and business conduct, including verification of our product supply chain to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery.

To that end, we regularly ask our Business Partners to self-certify their compliance with the principles in our Business Partner Code (either in a contract and/or a Business Partner Code of Conduct self- certification form). Suppliers are expected to designate management staff to monitor their factories, production facilities and compliance with our Business Partner Code. Our supply agreements also contain representations that our business partners are in compliance with all applicable federal, state and/or provincial, regional, municipal, and local laws, codes, regulations, rules, ordinances, decrees, permits, registrations and orders, which would include laws addressing human trafficking and slavery. In addition, Clorox may conduct semi-announced visits and/or have third-parties monitor visits to ensure compliance with the Business Partner Code, including compliance with prohibition on slavery and human trafficking. Clorox also requires in the Code that business partners certify that materials incorporated into Clorox’s products comply with the laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business.

The Clorox Compliance Hotline, where permissible under local laws, is available to all employees, directors and contractors, as well as our business partners, their employees or their subcontractors. The hotline, where permissible, enables the reporting of noncompliance by Clorox’s business partners, their employees or subcontractors. Clorox employees who do not act promptly to report noncompliance matters may be subject to disciplinary action.

We provide all non-production employees regular training regarding compliance with the

Clorox Code of Conduct, which also includes provisions prohibiting the use of forced labor. We have conducted global training for our product supply leadership, internal team members with direct responsibility for supply chain management, and have begun training our business partners to identify and address risks of slavery and trafficking in our supply chain.

Finally, as part of our Responsible Sourcing & Sustainability program, we evaluate (and may use third parties to evaluate) our supply chains for risk, including human rights and labor risks such as trafficking and slavery. We support our Business Partner Code with site visits, self-assessments and third-party audits. We are active members of AIM-Progress and the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange (Sedex) through which have started engaging our business partners in Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audits. We support mutual recognition platforms for audits to encourage our business partners to focus on remediation and improvements rather than re-audit by multiple customers. In the event concerns arise, we will investigate the matter and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risk by either terminating the relationship or remediating to ensure our business partner is in compliance with our Business Partner Code."

Supplier Code of Conduct
The Company has also adopted and implemented a ""Supplier Code of Conduct."" The Supplier Code of Conduct describes the business practices and employment standards applicable to Callaway Golf's direct suppliers on a global basis. Click to view the Supplier Code of Conduct.

Direct suppliers receive copies of or have access to the Supplier Code of Conduct and many suppliers post the Code on site at their various locations.

HOW WE VERIFY COMPLIANCE

The Company uses various approaches to verify the absence of forced labor and child labor in our supply chain, including the following:

Supply Chain Qualification and Supplier Assessments 
Callaway Golf Company performs assessments of potential suppliers according to a risk-based approach. This approach includes preliminary risk assessments and supplier assessment questionnaires. New supplier screenings are generally conducted internally by Callaway Golf Company personnel. Ongoing supplier compliance is typically monitored by a combination of measures (as discussed below), including supplier self-assessments, Callaway Golf Company-conducted audits and third party audits. Callaway Golf Company uses tools such as regular questionnaires (which are administered by Callaway through a web-based service), that are completed by direct tier one suppliers and selected tier two suppliers.

Supplier Audits 
Callaway Golf Company's audit program evaluates suppliers' compliance with the Company's Supplier Code of Conduct. Various types of announced audits are conducted under this program, including onsite audits conducted or attended by Callaway Golf Company personnel, collaborative or self-audits, and periodic third-party on-site audits of practices and underlying management systems. If deficiencies are identified, suppliers are directed to produce corrective action plans. The corrective action plans typically outline how a supplier will resolve issues uncovered in audits. If any compliance issues are identified, the Company may terminate the supplier relationship or will require action by the supplier to rectify the problem within a designated timeframe.

Currently, site audits are scheduled at most direct supplier sites every two years. These audits are conducted by Callaway Golf Company or by a third party auditing company. The audits are semi-announced audits. This means that the suppliers are given a window of time when the audit will take place, but the exact date of the audit within the timeframe is unannounced.

Terms and Conditions in Purchase Orders and Agreements 
Callaway Golf Company has various agreements or purchasing terms and conditions in place with most direct suppliers, requiring them to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including laws regarding forced labor and child labor.

Corporate Purchasing Policy
Callaway Golf Company has a Corporate Purchasing Policy in place that applies to all US employees responsible for commitment of funds to external suppliers. The Policy also serves as a guide for all non-US employees. Applicable employees are responsible for understanding and complying with this Policy. Among other things, the Policy is designed to promote compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.

Supplier Certifications 
Over the course of the next 12 to 18 months (through 2013), Callaway Golf Company is introducing a program to require direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into the Company's products comply with the laws of the countries where the suppliers are doing business.

Product Compliance
Callaway Golf Company strives to ensure products comply with applicable laws and regulations through education, testing, certifications and audits.

Conflict Free Sourcing
Callaway Golf Company has policies and procedures to reasonably assure that the use of the tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in the products manufactured do not directly or indirectly finance armed groups in Covered Countries as defined by the Conflict Minerals Rule issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Click to view Callaway’s Conflict Mineral Policy.

Employee and Supplier Training
Callaway Golf Company educates employees responsible for supplier programs on how to identify and report compliance issues. Callaway Golf Company also strives to educate suppliers on relevant regulatory requirements, programs and Company policies.

Company Legal Compliance Committee and Internal Audit Department
Callaway Golf Company has formed a Legal Compliance Committee to address compliance issues on a global basis and to develop systems and procedures to address any ongoing compliance issues in the locations where we conduct operations. The Legal Compliance Committee meets on a regular basis and the Chief Ethics Officer provides updates of key findings to the Callaway Golf Company Board of Directors.

The Company also has an Internal Audit Department that periodically tests supplier compliance with contract terms through a variety of methods. The Company also seeks to promptly address internal accountability standards and procedures for employees or contractors failing to meet Callaway Golf Company standards.

As one of the most recognized brands in consumer-electronics retailing, RadioShack Corporation has developed policies that reflect responsible business practices across the organization and throughout the global community of business partners and stakeholders. 

RadioShack has a longstanding corporate Code of Ethics Policy and a Supplier Code of Conduct that set clear boundaries for the relationships and practices with our suppliers and other business partners. Under these policies, RadioShack strives to do business with high moral, ethical and legal standards. RadioShack’s goal is to forge relationships with those suppliers who share our commitment to these standards.

In compliance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, effective Jan. 1, 2012, RadioShack is providing consumers with a summary of our practices covered by the Act so they are equipped to make informed choices about supporting RadioShack as a community-based retailer of innovative technology products and services. 

Disclosure

RadioShack is committed to compliance with all federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations that apply to its business. This compliance extends to RadioShack’s efforts to require that its suppliers comply with all applicable laws and, likewise, participate in the global effort to eradicate human trafficking and other instances of forced labor.

RadioShack enters into binding, written supply contracts with suppliers who wish to conduct business with RadioShack. The primary document used for this purpose is RadioShack’s Vendor Agreement, which incorporates RadioShack’s applicable policies in the Vendor Guide and Supplier Code of Conduct. As required by these policies, suppliers must comply with all applicable U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations, as well as applicable foreign laws, regulations and rules. RadioShack has the right to refuse any product offered by a supplier that fails to comply with all such laws and regulations.

As required by the Vendor Guide’s Supplier Code of Conduct, RadioShack’s suppliers must provide safe working conditions, treat their employees with respect and dignity, must not subject any employee to any physical or other form of abuse, and must engage in fair and reasonable practices relating to hiring, training, wages, benefits, discipline, termination and retirement, consistent with local standards and applicable law.

RadioShack’s Supplier Code of Conduct explicitly forbids use of forced, bonded, indentured or prison labor by its suppliers and also includes requirements concerning minimum age and compliance with other related local laws.

RadioShack requires that its suppliers must not employ or conduct business with any persons or entities that are blocked by U.S. agencies, including purchase of components, products or services from those countries or vendors that may be blocked or embargoed as a result of labor practices. RadioShack requires our suppliers to monitor changes in status on various lists published by federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Commerce.

Further, RadioShack’s suppliers are to implement, maintain and enforce appropriate policies, record-keeping practices and procedures to promote compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct and applicable laws.

Supply Chain Verification and Audits

RadioShack retains third-party auditing firms to evaluate and verify compliance with its Supplier Code of Conduct. RadioShack reserves the right to conduct these visits and audits unannounced, and will do so should the need arise. RadioShack is committed to ongoing dialogue with our suppliers concerning local labor practices in the interest of continuing to improve the quality and transparency of our global supply chain. 

Internal Accountability

If any of these facility visits or audits identifies deficiencies, the supplier must promptly develop and implement corrective actions to eliminate the identified deficiencies. RadioShack closely monitors the implementation of the necessary corrective action plan. The supplier’s failure to eliminate any identified deficiency in accordance with the Vendor Agreement, Vendor Guide and Supplier Code of Conduct may result in RadioShack’s termination of any and all applicable business relationships. 

Training

In addition to annual employee training on its ethics standards, RadioShack also conducts annual training sessions to inform all employees who are directly involved with global sourcing activities of the definitions of forced labor, human trafficking, common illegal labor practices, and RadioShack’s policies and procedures, as well as RadioShack’s reporting responsibilities concerning these activities. Properly educating these employees is a key element of RadioShack’s efforts to maintain and promote responsible practices in the global supply chain.

RadioShack is committed to conducting its business and operations consistent with legally recognized standards for corporate responsibility. RadioShack expects each of our suppliers in our direct supply chain to similarly conform to these standards and to fulfill the goals of responsible corporate citizenship.

No	306	"Supplier Conduct

Caterpillar expects its suppliers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. We disclose certain information as required by the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010.

Supplier Conduct

We believe that Caterpillar’s strength is based, in part, on our ability to develop and sustain long-lasting, mutually rewarding relationships with our suppliers. In accordance with Our Values in Action, we seek out suppliers who demonstrate strong values and ethical principles. We avoid those who violate the law or fail to comply with the sound business practices we embrace.

Caterpillar’s standard purchase order terms require our suppliers to represent that they have complied and will continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations that could result in liability to Caterpillar. These include product regulatory standards, environmental requirements, the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and export regulations.

We are asked from time to time about our commitment to various international human rights, including initiatives to counter human trafficking and slavery. We believe that our Code of Conduct, Our Values in Action, effectively articulates our long-standing support for, and commitment to, human rights and the dignity of all people. Our employees and management receive regular training and participate in annual assessments to ensure that they are aware of and able to apply the principles contained in Our Values in Action. We also maintain internal reporting mechanisms to hold employees and management accountable for any failure to comply with Our Values in Action.

A recent California law, the Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, requires certain disclosures regarding human trafficking and slavery, in particular. As described above, we select suppliers who support our values and expect them to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. We do not currently verify our product supply chain or audit suppliers specifically to evaluate risks of human trafficking and slavery or require our direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into products comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the countries in which they are doing business. We also do not currently maintain internal standards for employees and contractors regarding slavery and human trafficking specifically or provide training to employees and management on these specific matters. Caterpillar employees and management do receive regular training on Our Values in Action and are expected to respect the human rights and dignity of all people."

Yes	50	"Corporate disclosure under SB 657 — California Transparency in Supply Chains Act

Central Garden & Pet Company has always sought to operate its business operations so as to respect and further the interests of consumers, customers and the public at large. Our intent is to accomplish this not only through the products we make and sell but also through the processes and relationships that help create these products.

The California Legislature has passed the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) which went into effect on January 1, 2012. This legislation requires that companies that meet certain size or sales standards must disclose what they are doing to monitor and discourage possible slavery and human trafficking in the supply chain aspect of their operations.

We believe that there are no circumstances under which it would be acceptable for forced or trafficked labor to be used in the production of any of our products.

As part of our efforts directed against human trafficking and slavery, we have a rigorous assessment process for all vendors, especially overseas vendors. This assessment process includes questionnaires directed at practices that could implicate issues relevant to human trafficking and slavery. As part of the assessment and verification process, potential vendors are and will be required to certify that they and any materials they use in the making of our products comply with applicable slavery and human trafficking laws. As we reassess existing vendor relationships, they will be required to certify or recertify such compliance. We have also retained a third party inspection company to conduct random inspections of factories that provide us with products or components in order to further assist us in monitoring vendor compliance with human trafficking, and slavery prohibitions.

We also are implementing a program to ensure that agreements with relevant suppliers require strict compliance with company standards regarding forced labor and human trafficking and with international and local legal requirements.

Central maintains internal standards and procedures making both its employees and outside contractors accountable for meeting company requirements relevant to human trafficking and slavery issues. As to outside contractors and vendors, the consequences of failing to meet such requirements can result in financial penalties and suspension or discontinuance of the business relationship.

We also provide company employees with training regarding both the legal requirements applicable to human trafficking and slavery issues and how those requirements impact supply side management. This training is directed at employees and managers who have responsibility for supply side issues and includes topics relevant to both recognition and mitigation of risks relevant to human trafficking and slavery issues."
