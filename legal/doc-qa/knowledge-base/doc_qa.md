UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS
JESSICA TANNER, individually, and on behalf of other members of the general public similarly situated,
Plaintiff,

v.

TECH SOLUTIONS, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company; TECH SOLUTIONS, INC., a Delaware corporation; INNOVATE CORP., a Delaware corporation; and DOES 1 through 100, inclusive,
Defendants.

Plaintiff Jessica Tanner brings her Class Action Complaint against Defendants Tech Solutions, LLC, Tech Solutions, Inc., and Innovate Corp., along with 100 Doe Defendants, alleging that Defendants violated various Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act provisions and Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act as a result. Defendants again seek dismissal, arguing that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim. For the reasons set forth below, the Court GRANTS Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 22), but Plaintiff is GRANTED leave to amend one more time.

No. 1:24-cv01563-JHC-JD

ORDER GRANTING MOTION TO DISMISS WITH LEAVE TO AMEND
BACKGROUND
I. Factual Background
Plaintiff is an Illinois resident who worked for Defendants. (See Second Am. Class Action Compl. for Damages (ECF No. 21) ¶¶ 5, 18 ("Second Amended Complaint" or "SAC").) Plaintiff was an hourly-paid, non-exempt Customer Support Specialist. (See id. ¶ 18.) Defendants operate a technology solutions business, providing IT consulting and software development services to clients nationwide. (See id. ¶ 20.)

Plaintiff generally alleges that Defendants violated Illinois labor laws and wage payment statutes by:

Failing to pay overtime (see id. ¶¶ 45-53);
Failing to provide accurate wage statements (see id. ¶¶ 54-63);
Failing to reimburse necessary business expenses (see id. ¶¶ 64-72);
Failing to pay wages upon termination (see id. ¶¶ 73-81); and
Engaging in deceptive business practices under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (see id. ¶¶ 82-89).
II. Procedural Background
Plaintiff initially filed her Class Action Complaint in Cook County Circuit Court. (See ECF No. 1.) Defendants removed the case to federal court. (See id.)

Following removal, Defendants filed their first motion to dismiss. (See ECF No. 8.) The Court denied the motion without prejudice, citing procedural deficiencies. (See ECF No. 12.) Plaintiff subsequently filed her First Amended Complaint (ECF No. 14), which was replaced by the operative Second Amended Complaint (ECF No. 21) following a stipulation between the parties.

Defendants then filed the present Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 22). Plaintiff filed her Opposition (ECF No. 24), and Defendants filed their Reply (ECF No. 25). The Court heard oral arguments, during which Attorney Laura Martinez appeared for Plaintiff, and Attorney Michael Donovan appeared for Defendants. The matter is now fully briefed.

DISCUSSION
III. Legal Standard
A party may move to dismiss for "failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted." Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The motion may be granted if the complaint lacks a "cognizable legal theory" or if its factual allegations do not support a cognizable legal theory. Doe v. Loyola Univ. Chicago, 919 F.3d 658, 664 (7th Cir. 2019). The court assumes all factual allegations are true and construes them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. McCauley v. City of Chicago, 671 F.3d 611, 616 (7th Cir. 2011).

A complaint need only contain a "short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief," Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), but it must include sufficient factual matter to make the claim plausible. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009). Conclusory statements or formulaic recitations of elements are insufficient. Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).

IV. Analysis
A. Overtime and Wage Statement Claims
Defendants argue that Plaintiff's claims for unpaid overtime and inaccurate wage statements fail to meet the pleading standard established in Landers v. Quality Commc'ns, Inc., 771 F.3d 638 (9th Cir. 2014). The Court agrees.

1. Overtime Claims
Plaintiff alleges that she "regularly worked more than 40 hours per week without receiving overtime pay." (SAC ¶ 46.) However, she fails to provide specific examples of weeks where this occurred or details about the hours worked and wages owed. As the Seventh Circuit has noted, "a plaintiff must provide sufficient factual content to raise a right to relief above the speculative level." McCauley, 671 F.3d at 616.

Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the overtime claim.

2. Wage Statement Claims
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants issued wage statements that "failed to accurately reflect hours worked and wages earned." (SAC ¶ 55.) However, Plaintiff does not identify specific inaccuracies or explain how these inaccuracies caused harm. Without such details, the claim is insufficient under Rule 8.

The Court GRANTS Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the wage statement claim.

B. Business Expense Reimbursement
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to reimburse her for necessary business expenses, such as cell phone usage and home office supplies. (SAC ¶¶ 64-72.) While Plaintiff provides some examples, she does not allege the approximate amounts or dates of these expenses.

The Court GRANTS Defendants' Motion to Dismiss this claim but allows Plaintiff leave to amend to provide additional details.

C. Termination Wages
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants failed to pay all wages owed upon her termination, in violation of the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act. (SAC ¶¶ 73-81.) However, Plaintiff does not specify the amount of unpaid wages or the circumstances of her termination.

The Court GRANTS Defendants' Motion to Dismiss this claim.

D. Deceptive Business Practices
Plaintiff alleges that Defendants engaged in deceptive practices by misrepresenting their compliance with wage and hour laws. (SAC ¶¶ 82-89.) However, Plaintiff fails to identify specific misrepresentations or reliance on those misrepresentations.

The Court GRANTS Defendants' Motion to Dismiss this claim.

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, the Court GRANTS Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (ECF No. 22). Plaintiff is GRANTED leave to amend, except with respect to claims for restitution under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. Plaintiff has 21 days from the docketing of this Order to file her Third Amended Complaint. Defendants will have 21 days thereafter to respond.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
