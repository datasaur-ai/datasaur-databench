1. Section 5.03(a)(ii) contains the core “no-shop” restrictions, providing that, from the signing date until the earlier of the Effective Time or termination of the Agreement, the Company and its representatives will not, directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate any Competing Proposal (clause (A)), furnish non-public information to a party making a Competing Proposal (clause (B)), engage in discussions or negotiations regarding a Competing Proposal (clause (C)), enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement (clause (D)), or agree to take any such prohibited actions (clause (E)).  

2. These prohibitions are subject only to the narrow carve-out in the proviso at the end of Section 5.03(a), which permits the Company to inform a third party making an inquiry that the Company is contractually prohibited from engaging with it.

2.  Fiduciary Exception (Section 5.03(b))  
    –  Notwithstanding the no-shop obligation, if all of the following are true before the Company Stockholder Approval or termination:  
       a.  The Company receives a bona fide written “Competing Proposal” that was not solicited in breach of Section 5.03(a).  
       b.  The Company Board (or a committee) determines in good faith, after consulting its outside financial and legal advisors, that the Competing Proposal is—or would reasonably be expected to lead to—a “Superior Proposal.”  
       c.  The Board concludes that failing to engage with the bidder would likely violate the Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law.  
    –  Then the Company (and its representatives) may:  
       •  Furnish information (subject first to an “Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement” if the bidder isn’t already bound), and

   a.  The Company has received a written Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party that did not result from a material, intentional breach of the No-Shop provisions (i.e., Section 6.02(a)).

      i.  The proposal constitutes—or could reasonably be expected to lead to—a “Superior Proposal,” and

3. Permitted Actions Once Exception Applies (Section 6.02(b)(1) and (2))

   – The Company Board must determine in good faith, after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors, that the proposal:  
     • Takes into account factors the Board deems appropriate (e.g., conditionality, timing, likelihood of consummation)  
     • Would result in a transaction more favorable from a financial perspective to the Company’s stockholders than the Transactions under the Agreement (including consideration of any Company Termination Fee, if applicable).

"Consider the Acquisition Agreement between Parent ""Gainwell Acquisition Corp."" and Target ""HMS Holdings Corp.""; Is there a Tail provision for acquisition proposals","Based solely on the language of Section 9.03 of the Agreement, there is a “tail” provision covering acquisition proposals.  In particular:

1. Tail period  
   • Section 9.03(b)(D) provides that if this Agreement is terminated, then for the twelve (12)-month period following such termination the Company must pay the Company Termination Fee if an Acquisition Proposal is entered into or consummated.  

2. Triggers within the tail  
   • Entry into a definitive agreement for any Acquisition Proposal, regardless of the counterparty or when it was first made, within twelve months of termination.  
   • Consummation of any Acquisition Proposal within the same twelve-month period.  

3. Modified threshold  
   • For purposes of this tail provision, the definition of “Acquisition Proposal” is modified so that the usual twenty percent (20%) ownership threshold is deemed to be fifty percent (50%) (see the proviso in Section 9.03(b)(D)).

Citation:  
• Section 9.03(b)(D) – “within twelve (12) months following the termination of this Agreement, (1) the Company enters into a definitive agreement for the consummation of any Acquisition Proposal … or (2) any Acquisition Proposal is consummated … then the Company shall pay … the Company Termination Fee…”","maud/HMS Holdings Corp._Veritas Capital.txt"

2. Core Covenant  
   • From the date of the Agreement until the earlier of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) termination under Section 9.01, the Company and its Subsidiaries must:

   b. Required by Applicable Law;  
   c. “Expressly contemplated by this Agreement”; or  
   d. Taken with the “prior written consent of Parent” (which consent “shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed”).
