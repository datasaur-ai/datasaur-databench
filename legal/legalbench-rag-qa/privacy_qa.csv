"Consider ""Fiverr""'s privacy policy; who can see which tasks i hire workers for?","Based solely on the excerpt you’ve provided from Fiverr’s Privacy Policy, there is no information about who can see which tasks you hire workers for. The passage you shared addresses only the types of data Fiverr collects when you use the Site (e.g., geo‑location, IP address, device/browser data, web‑log information, and user communications).  

Because the policy excerpt does not cover visibility or sharing of your hiring activities, we cannot determine from this text:  
  • Whether other users, third parties, or Fiverr staff can view the specific tasks you post or hire for, or  
  • Under what circumstances (if any) such information might be shared.

To answer your question, you would need to refer to sections of the privacy policy that address data sharing, user profiles, or confidentiality—none of which are included in the provided context.","privacy_qa/Fiverr.txt"

• The provided text contains no provision describing who can view the gigs or jobs you post.  
• We cannot determine from this snippet whether postings are public, limited to certain users, or otherwise restricted.

"Consider ""Fiverr""'s privacy policy; how does fiverr ensure payments to freelancers are secure?","Based on the excerpts you’ve provided from Fiverr’s Privacy Policy, Fiverr secures payments to freelancers as follows:

1. Use of Third‑Party Payment Vendors

   • Fiverr “is not exposed to the payment information provided to our payment vendors, and this information is subject to the privacy policy applicable to the payment vendor.” (Context ¶2)

2. Contractual Security Obligations

4. User‑Controlled Access  
   • Registered users must “keep their password in strict confidence and not disclose such password to any third party,” thereby reducing risk of account takeover. (Context ¶6)

Limitations:  
• Fiverr notes that “transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure … any transmission is at your own risk.” (Context ¶4)  

No further details (e.g. specific encryption standards or audit protocols) are provided in the excerpts supplied.","privacy_qa/Fiverr.txt"

1. No sale or rental for marketing  
   • “We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.”

1. Scope of Collection  
   • “When you access the Site … we may gather, collect and record the information relating to such usage, including geo‑location information …”  
   • Citation: provided context (geo‑location information is listed among the data “we may gather”)

2. Constant Tracking?  
   • The policy states Fiverr “may” collect geo‑location data whenever you use the Site.  
   • It does not specify that your location is tracked continuously in real time when you are not actively on the Site.  

3. Insufficient Detail  
   • No language in the provided context clarifies frequency (e.g., interval‑based polling vs. one‑time capture at login).  
   • Without additional sections of the policy, we cannot determine whether tracking is “constant,” intermittent, or only at session start/end.  

Conclusion  
– Fiverr’s policy permits collection of your geo‑location while you use the Site but does not explicitly commit to, nor rule out, continuous background tracking. Further detail would be needed from the full policy to answer definitively.","privacy_qa/Fiverr.txt"
"Consider ""Fiverr""'s privacy policy; will potential employers be able to obtain my address?","Based solely on the excerpts you’ve provided:

   • The policy does not state that your physical address is automatically published.  
   • Only information you “choose to add to your profile” becomes visible to other users.  

Conclusion  
• Unless you explicitly include your physical address in your public profile, potential employers (or any other users) will not be able to see it.  

Note: The policy doesn’t address whether Fiverr might share your address privately with third parties or under legal compulsion; no such sharing is described in the provided text.","privacy_qa/Fiverr.txt"

1. All registrants’ basic identifiers and activity data are publicly visible

3. What you cannot control (per the provided text)

2. Sharing with third-party service providers  
   “We may provide your personal details to third parties, only in order to operate the Site, provide our services to you, fulfil obligations imposed on us by applicable laws and regulations, and prevent fraud and illegal activities, as detailed below:”  
   – Fiverr may disclose your personal details to third parties, but only for the limited purposes listed (operation, service provision, legal compliance, fraud prevention).  
   – The exact personal details shared and the identities of those third parties are not specified in the excerpt you supplied.

3. Insufficient detail  
   – The policy excerpt does not specify which “personal details” are disclosed to third parties, nor under what precise conditions.  
   – It is therefore unclear from this text alone how much of your private information (beyond what you publish in your profile) may be shared outside Fiverr.

Conclusion  
– Yes. Other Fiverr Users can see all profile content you publish (username, photos, portfolio, Gigs, ratings, etc.).  
– Yes. Fiverr also shares certain personal details with third parties—but the provided text does not specify exactly what data is shared or to whom.","privacy_qa/Fiverr.txt"

   • Charge buyers for services purchased on the Site; and  
   • Transfer payments to sellers on the Site.  
3. Fiverr “is not exposed” to any of your payment data—meaning Fiverr employees, other users, or any external parties apart from the payment vendors have no access to it.  
4. Any handling of your financial information by those payment vendors is governed by **their** respective privacy policies (not Fiverr’s).

   • No. “We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent.” (Context, first sentence)  

2. Do you ever share my personal information with third parties?  
   • Yes, but only for limited, non‑marketing purposes:  
     – To operate the Site and provide services to you  
     – To comply with legal obligations and prevent fraud or illegal activities

1. Fiverr does not itself collect or store your payment (credit/card) information.  
   • “We do not collect credit information; but allow our payment vendors to collect information…” (Context)

2. All payment data is handled by third-party payment vendors, for both:  
   a. charging buyers on the Site  
   b. transferring funds to sellers on the Site  

3. Fiverr never sees or retains your raw payment data; instead:  
   • “We are not exposed to the payment information provided to our payment vendors, and this information is subject to the privacy policy applicable to the payment vendor.” (Context)

4. The policy excerpt does not itself describe any specific security standards or encryption methods.  
   • No mention of “secure payment service,” PCI-DSS compliance, SSL/TLS, or similar safeguards appears in the provided text.

Conclusion  
• Fiverr relies on its selected payment vendors to process and secure your payment data.  
• Whether those vendors employ “secure payment services” must be confirmed by reviewing each vendor’s own privacy/security policy, which is outside the scope of the text you provided.","privacy_qa/Fiverr.txt"

1. To provide and secure the core marketplace services (Context ¶1–3)  
   • Perform or enter into a contract with you (e.g., enable payment/withdrawal of funds, send physical goods).  
   • Verify your identity, establish/set up your account, re‑issue passwords and log your activity.

2. To enhance and personalize your experience (Context ¶2, ¶4)

5. With your consent for any additional purposes not listed above (Context ¶5)  

6. For direct marketing (Context “Direct marketing” section)

"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; who has access to my workout plans?","Based on the excerpts you’ve provided from Keep’s Privacy Policy:

1.  Payment‐related affiliates  
   - “Where we or our affiliate companies process your payments … we may collect, use and store your Personal Information … in order to fulfill such purchases.”  
   - Citation: “Where we or our affiliate companies … fulfill any purchases you have made on Keep, we may collect, use and store your Personal Information in order to fulfill such purchases.”

2.  Third-party social platforms (only if you opt in)  
   - “You may also choose to share your activity on other platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.”  
   - Citation: “You may also choose to share your activity on other platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.”

Note:  
–   The provided text does not explicitly define “workout plans” as “Personal Information,” nor does it state any other parties (e.g. internal teams, analytics providers, advertisers) have access.  
–   Therefore, beyond payment‐processing affiliates and any social platforms you explicitly share with, no additional recipients of your workout plans are identified in the supplied policy excerpts.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; will my fitness coach share my information with others?","Based solely on the excerpts you’ve provided, Keep’s Privacy Policy states:  

1. “Other than consented by you, we commit that we will not sell your personal information to any other third parties for their processing for any purposes.”  
2. “We will not disclose or transfer your personal information to any non‑affiliated third parties, unless:  
   • You may choose to share certain information.  
   • In order to participate in certain features, you may have to adjust your Privacy settings and share more information.  
   • You may also choose to share your activity on other platforms…”  

– Because your fitness coach would be a non‑affiliated third party, Keep will not share your information with them (or with anyone else) unless you have explicitly consented or have actively shared that data via your settings or platform permissions.  

Note: The policy excerpt does not specifically define “fitness coach,” but under its general terms on third‑party disclosures, no sharing occurs without your consent.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; will my progress only be posted to social media if i want it to?","Based solely on the single sentence you’ve provided from Keep’s privacy policy:

  “We will not disclose or transfer your personal information to any non-affiliated third parties, unless:”

1. That sentence establishes a general rule of non-disclosure to non-affiliated third parties.  
2. It does not explicitly address whether or how your workout progress (or any other activity) may be shared on social media.  
3. No exception clauses or specific user-consent provisions are included in the excerpt.

Conclusion: The excerpt is silent as to social-media posting of your progress and does not state that such sharing requires your affirmative consent. Additional portions of the privacy policy—specifically any clauses that follow “unless:” or sections on user controls and sharing—would be needed to determine whether your progress is posted only if you choose.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; will any photos i take be accessed by outside parties?","Based solely on the excerpts you’ve provided, there is no mention of photos (or image files) being collected, stored, shared or otherwise accessed by any third parties. Specifically:

1. Payment processing (third‑party or in‑house)  
   – Only transaction summaries or Personal Information related to purchases are mentioned.  
   – No reference to photos or media files.  

2. Social‑media sharing (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)  
   – You “may choose to share your activity,” but “activity” is not defined to include photos.  
   – There is no indication that photos from your device are automatically shared.  

3. Apple HealthKit data  
   – Health metrics (age, weight, heart rate) are protected and not shared without your authorization.  
   – Again, no mention of photos.  

Because the policy excerpts make no reference to photos, there is no basis in the provided text to conclude that photos you take will be accessed by outside parties. Additional sections of the privacy policy would be needed to answer definitively.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; will my information be shared with other companies for marketing?","Based on the excerpts you provided from Keep’s Privacy Policy, Keep does not share your personal information with unaffiliated third-party companies for marketing purposes, except in the limited circumstances you yourself initiate.  Specifically:  

1. “We will not disclose or transfer your personal information to any non-affiliated third parties, unless:

   • You may also choose to share your activity on other platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.”  
   (Privacy Policy, “We will not disclose…” section)  

2. All other uses of your Personal Information (e.g., payment processing, fulfilling purchases) occur only with Keep or its affiliates—not with unrelated marketing partners.

"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; will the app use my data for marketing purposes?","Based solely on the excerpts you’ve provided, there is no indication that Keep uses your Personal Information for marketing purposes.  In particular:

1. Purposes expressly stated (see provided context):  
   • Payment processing and fulfillment of purchases  
   • Enabling app functionalities via Location Data and Log Data  
   • Accessing additional device content (e.g. contacts, photos) only if you grant permission

   – No mention is made of collecting credentials or data from other apps (e.g., Twitter, Instagram).

2. Third-Party Disclosure  
   – “We will not disclose or transfer your personal information to any non-affiliated third parties, unless: …” (Disclosure section)  
   – This clause addresses sharing your personal data; it does not imply that Keep accesses or syncs with your other apps.

Conclusion  
– There is no language in the provided context indicating that Keep accesses or integrates with third-party applications such as Twitter or Instagram.  
– Information is insufficient to confirm any such access; the policy excerpts neither authorize nor describe linking to other social media apps.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; how safe is my account information on this app?","Based solely on the excerpts you’ve provided, here is what Keep’s privacy policy says about the safety of your account information:

1. Security measures  
   • “We use a variety of security measures, including encryption and authentication tools, to help protect your information.”  
   • Credit‑card data is “transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted within our databases.”  

2. Data deletion and retention  
   • You may delete content or your entire account at any time. If you cannot, you can contact support@gotokeep.com.  
   • “In some cases, we retain data for limited periods when it needs to be kept for legitimate business or legal purposes or to be protected from accidental or malicious deletion,” and there “may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.”  

3. Server locations  
   • “We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live.”  

4. Disclaimer of absolute security  
   • “However, like other companies, we cannot guarantee 100% the security or confidentiality of the information you provide to us.”  

Conclusion  
• Keep employs standard industry measures (encryption, SSL, authentication) to safeguard your data and offers account‑deletion mechanisms.  
• It discloses possible delays in purging deleted data and cross‑border processing of your information.  
• It expressly disclaims any promise of perfect security or confidentiality.  

No additional detail (e.g., specific encryption standards, audit practices or breach‑notification procedures) is provided in the excerpts, so a more granular assessment isn’t possible from the material given.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; are my statistics kept private?","Based solely on the excerpts you’ve provided, there is no explicit statement that your “statistics” are kept private. In fact, the policy excerpts indicate the following:  

1. Collection, use and storage of Personal Information for purchase-fulfillment  
   • “Where we or our affiliate companies process your payments … we may collect, use and store your Personal Information in order to fulfill such purchases.”  
     – (Context, first paragraph)  

2. Optional sharing of your activity on third-party platforms  
   • “You may also choose to share your activity on other platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.”  
     – (Context, second paragraph)  

Missing from these excerpts is any proviso that your statistics (e.g., usage metrics, performance data) are treated as private or confidential. No clause addresses how Keep handles, secures or discloses statistics beyond payment-related data or user-initiated sharing.  

Conclusion  
• There is insufficient information in the provided policy text to affirm that your statistics are kept private.  
• The policy, as quoted, neither guarantees privacy nor describes restrictions on statistical data processing or disclosure.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; who can see my data?","Based solely on the excerpts you’ve provided, the following parties may be able to see or access your data:  

1. Keep and its affiliate companies  
   • “Where we or our affiliate companies process your payments … we may collect, use and store your Personal Information …”  
   (Context, first sentence)  

2. Any third‑party platforms you opt into  
   • “You may also choose to share your activity on other platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.”  
   (Context, last sentence)  

3. Parties involved in certain features, if you adjust your privacy settings  
   • “In order to participate in certain features, you may have to adjust your Privacy settings and share more information.”  
   (Context, second sentence)  

Note: The provided text does not specify which affiliates or feature‑related parties beyond the above, nor what level of access each has.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; does the app access my contact list?","Based solely on the excerpt you’ve provided, there is no indication that Keep accesses your contact list.  

• The only categories of personal information mentioned are:  
  1. “Information you make available to us when you open a Keep account…” (no further detail in the excerpt about contacts)  
  2. Payment data processed by a third-party provider, which Keep does not collect or store (they may receive only summary transaction information).  

Because the provided policy text does not reference “contacts,” “address book,” or any similar term, we cannot conclude that Keep accesses your contact list. Additional sections of the privacy policy would be needed to confirm otherwise.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; is my data safe?","Based solely on the excerpts you’ve provided, Keep’s policy on data safety can be summarized as follows:

1. Security Measures  
   • “We use a variety of security measures, including encryption and authentication tools, to help protect your information.”  
   • “All credit card information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted within our databases.”  
   • “We use secure servers when you place orders.”  

2. Data Deletion & Retention  
   • You may delete or remove your own content at any time; for anything you cannot delete, you must contact support@gotokeep.com.  
   • “In some cases, we retain data for limited periods when it needs to be kept for legitimate business or legal purposes or to be protected from accidental or malicious deletion.”  
   • There “may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.”

3. Geographic Processing  
   • “We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live.”

4. No Absolute Guarantee  
   • “However, like other companies, we cannot guarantee 100% the security or confidentiality of the information you provide to us.”

Conclusion  
– Keep employs industry‑standard protections (encryption, SSL, secure servers) and offers deletion controls, but it explicitly disclaims any absolute guarantee of security or confidentiality. Therefore, while your data benefits from multiple safeguards, no system is infallible under this policy.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; are you storing any of my information?","Based on the excerpts you’ve provided from Keep’s Privacy Policy, Keep does collect and store certain categories of your personal information.  In particular:

1. Core personal data for training  
   • “We need your age, height and weight to calculate your consumption of calorie when you complete each training class.”  
   – Keep therefore stores your age, height and weight.  

2. Account-opening and profile information (section “For example, we may collect Personal Information …”)  
   • Information you provide when opening a Keep account.  
   • Profile data you make publicly visible (e.g. profile ID, name, photo).  

3. Usage-related data  
   • Location data and log data generated while you use Keep.  
   • Information from your communications with customer support.  

4. Purchase-related information  
   • Any personal data (e.g. credit card or bank account details) you submit to complete a purchase.  
   • Note: “Where the payment is processed by a third-party payment service provider, we do not collect or store such Personal Information, though we may receive summary information about transactions.”  

Conclusion  
– Yes. Keep collects and retains multiple types of your personal information, except that full payment-instrument details are handled by a third-party processor (Keep only receives transaction summaries).","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; do you access any of my contact's information?","Based solely on the excerpts you’ve provided:

1. “Information you make available to us when you open a Keep account, as set out above”  
2. “Where the payment is processed by a third‑party payment service provider, we do not collect or store such Personal Information, though we may receive summary information about transactions.”  

– Neither clause refers to accessing or collecting your contacts’ information.  
– No part of the supplied text indicates that Keep reads, imports or otherwise accesses data from your address book or contact lists.  

Conclusion: There is no indication in the provided policy excerpts that Keep accesses any of your contacts’ information.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; does it save any of my health data?","Based solely on the excerpts you’ve provided:

1. Data Collected  
   • “We need your age, height and weight to calculate your consumption of calorie when you complete each training class.”  
   – This shows Keep collects (i.e. “needs”) your age, height, and weight.

2. Data Sharing  
   • Keep may share “personal information” (which would include age, height, weight) in good-faith circumstances to satisfy legal or security requirements.

3. No Explicit Storage/Retention Terms Provided  
   • Nowhere in the provided text does Keep state that it “saves,” “stores,” or “retains” your health data (age, height, weight) beyond using it for calorie calculations.  
   • Because the policy excerpt does not address data storage or retention, we cannot conclude whether Keep saves your health data.

Conclusion  
• The policy excerpt confirms collection (for calorie-use calculations) but does not explicitly state storage or retention practices. Additional policy language would be needed to determine if and how Keep saves your health data.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; can the app access my location?","Based solely on the excerpts you’ve provided from Keep’s privacy policy:

• No mention of location data  
  – The two sections you cited (public profile information and purchase‑related payment data) do not refer to GPS, IP‑based, or any other form of location tracking or collection.  

• Insufficient information  
  – Because the excerpts do not address location at all, we cannot conclude whether Keep may or may not access your location.  

If you need to know Keep’s practices regarding location data, please refer to the portion of the policy that specifically covers “Location Information,” “Device Data,” or similar terminology.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; is any information shared with third parties?","Based solely on the excerpts you provided, Keep does not share your personal information with non-affiliated third parties unless you explicitly consent or take certain actions.  In particular:

1. No sale of personal data  
   • “Other than consented by you, we commit that we will not sell your personal information to any other third parties for their processing for any purposes.”  

2. No disclosure or transfer to non-affiliated third parties except as you choose  
   • “We will not disclose or transfer your personal information to any non-affiliated third parties, unless:  
     – You may choose to share certain information.  
     – In order to participate in certain features, you may have to adjust your Privacy settings and share more information.  
     – You may also choose to share your activity on other platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.”  

3. Sensitive data requires explicit consent  
   • “We will ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.”  

4. Affiliates and payment service providers  
   • Keep may share data with its affiliates or a payment service provider “where we or our affiliate companies process your payments … we may collect, use and store your Personal Information in order to fulfill such purchases.”  

No other sharing to third parties is disclosed in the provided policy.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; can it access my other social media accounts?","Based solely on the excerpt you’ve provided:

1. Registration Information (no mention of social accounts)  
   • “To register, you may need to provide certain Personal Information, such as your name, mobile phone number, password, exercise goal and status.”  
   – Context: Registration requirements  

2. Data‑sharing promise (no exception for accessing your social accounts)  
   • “We will not disclose or transfer your personal information to any non‑affiliated third parties, unless: …”  
   – Context: Data‑sharing restrictions  

Conclusion  
• Nowhere in the provided text does Keep state that it will access or link to your other social media accounts.  
• The excerpt contains no provisions authorizing such access.  

Insufficiency of the record  
• Because the policy fragment ends before any “unless” conditions are detailed, we cannot determine whether any later section permits social‑media access.  
• Additional text would be needed to confirm or deny any such feature.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; what information will this app have access to of mine?","Based solely on the excerpts you provided from Keep’s Privacy Policy, Keep will collect or have access to the following categories of your personal information:

    •  Age, height and weight (to calculate calorie consumption)  
    •  Name, mobile phone number, password, exercise goal and status  
    •  Profile ID, name and photo (from your publicly visible Keep profile)  
    (Context “We need your age…”, “To register, you may need…”, “Any information included in your publicly visible Keep profile…”)

2.  Usage-Derived Information  
    •  Contact list (if you share it via the “Recommended Friends” function)  
    •  Location data and log data generated during your use of the app  
    (Context “via your use of Keep … a) Your sharing of your contact list…”, “Information we collect in the course of you using Keep such as certain location data and log data”)

3.  Purchase-Related Information  
    •  Credit-card or bank-account details and purchase history when you buy within Keep  
    •  Summary transaction information (if payment is processed by a third-party provider; Keep does not store your full payment details)  
    (Context “Making purchases within Keep, including your credit card or bank details…”, “Where the payment is processed by a third-party… we do not collect or store such Personal Information, though we may receive summary information about transactions.”)

4.  Customer-Support Communications  
    •  Any information you provide when you contact Keep’s support team  
    (Context “Information you provide through your communications with our customer support team.”)

No other data categories are mentioned in the provided excerpts.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; will the personal info i share with this app to sign up be shared with other companies, etc?","Based solely on the excerpts you’ve provided from Keep’s Privacy Policy:

1. Sharing with affiliates or service providers  
   - Keep (or its “affiliate companies”) may share your personal information when processing or fulfilling payments you’ve made on Keep.  
     • Context reference: “Where we or our affiliate companies process your payments… we may collect, use and store your Personal Information in order to fulfill such purchases.”

2. No disclosure to non‑affiliated third parties, except as you direct  
   - Keep will not transfer your personal information to any non‑affiliated third party UNLESS one of the following applies (and only to the extent you choose):  
     a. You voluntarily share certain information.  
     b. You adjust your privacy settings to enable specific features.  
     c. You choose to share your activity on other platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram).  
     • Context reference: “We will not disclose or transfer your personal information to any non‑affiliated third parties, unless: You may choose to share… In order to participate in certain features… You may also choose to share your activity on other platforms…”

3. Automatic collections unrelated to third‑party sharing  
   - Keep does automatically collect Log Data, Location Data, and (if you permit) access your contacts or photos—but that collection is for internal functionality and not a transfer to third parties per the provided text.

Conclusion  
• Other than necessary sharing with Keep’s affiliates for payment processing, your personal information will not be shared with non‑affiliated third parties unless you explicitly opt in or adjust settings as noted above.  
• No further sharing is indicated in the provided excerpts.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"

1. No sale of your data without consent  
   – “Other than consented by you, we commit that we will not sell your personal information to any other third parties for their processing for any purposes.”  
   – Implication: Keep will not sell or “give” your workout (health) data to, for example, insurance companies, unless you have expressly agreed.

2. Explicit consent required for sensitive health data  
   – “We will ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information such as … health.”  
   – Implication: before any workout or health data is shared outside Keep, you would need to opt-in.

3. No transfer to non-affiliated third parties absent exception  
   – “We will not disclose or transfer your personal information to any non-affiliated third parties, unless: …”  
   – (The policy fragment you provided cuts off here.  No specific exception listing insurance companies appears in the text you supplied.)

4. User-initiated sharing  
   – You “may also choose to share your activity on other platforms,” e.g. Facebook or Instagram.  That is entirely at your discretion.

Conclusion  
Based on the provided language, Keep does not share or disclose your workout data to any third parties—including insurance companies—unless (a) you explicitly consent, (b) you choose to share on another platform, or (c) an exception (not fully shown) applies. There is no mention in your excerpts of automatic sharing with insurers.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; how well does keep protect my data and how do they do that?","Based solely on the excerpts you provided, Keep’s privacy policy describes several data‑protection measures and limitations.  In brief:

1. Data‑protection measures  
   a. Encryption & authentication  
      • “We use a variety of security measures, including encryption and authentication tools, to help protect your information.”  
        – (see context: security measures)  
   b. Secure servers  
      • “We use secure servers when you place orders.”  
        – (see context: secure servers)  
   c. SSL for payment data  
      • “All credit card information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted within our databases.”  
        – (see context: SSL transmission and database encryption)  

2. Data‑deletion & retention  
   a. User‑initiated deletion  
      • You may remove or delete individual content or your entire account yourself.  
      • If you cannot delete something, you may contact support@gotokeep.com.  
        – (see context: removal/deletion procedures)  
   b. Retention for business, legal or backup reasons  
      • “In some cases, we retain data for limited periods when it needs to be kept for legitimate business or legal purposes or to be protected from accidental or malicious deletion…”  
      • Deletions may be delayed while copies remain on active or backup systems.  
        – (see context: retention and deletion delays)

   • “We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live.”  
     – (see context: international processing)  

Assessment of “how well”  
• Keep employs industry‑standard practices (encryption, SSL, authentication, secure servers) to protect data.  
• They acknowledge residual risks (no 100% guarantee) and possible delays in complete deletion.  
• The policy does not specify technical details (e.g., encryption algorithms, audit procedures) or measurable security‑performance metrics, so a more precise evaluation is not possible based on the provided text alone.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; can people see what workout list i'm using?","Based solely on the excerpt you provided (the “Payment Processing” section of Keep’s Privacy Policy):

1. The excerpt explains that Keep (or its affiliates) may collect, use and store your Personal Information when processing payments for purchases.  
2. It does not address any sharing or visibility of your workout lists to other users or the public.  

Because the provided context says nothing about whether workout lists are visible to others, we cannot conclude from this text whether people can see which workout list you’re using. Additional sections of the privacy policy or the app’s terms of service would be needed to answer your question.","privacy_qa/Keep.txt"
"Consider ""Keep""'s privacy policy; can people see my workout log?","The excerpt you’ve provided addresses only how Keep collects, uses, and stores Personal Information to process and fulfill purchases. It does not speak to who can view your workout log.

1. Sharing with Affiliates  
   – “Where we or our affiliate companies process your payments as a payment service provider, or where we fulfill any purchases … we may collect, use and store your Personal Information in order to fulfill such purchases.”
