"Consider the Video-on-Demand Content License Agreement between Rogers Cable Communications Inc. and EuroMedia Holdings Corp.; Is there a most favored nation clause in this contract?","Yes. The Agreement contains a most-favoured-nation (“MFN”) clause in two respects:

1.   Earlier Availability Date MFN (Paragraph 1 of the Context)  
     – If Licensor grants another U.S. VOD or PPV service provider the right to distribute a Licensed Program on an earlier availability date, Licensor must grant Rogers the same earlier date on the same terms.

2.   More-Favourable-Terms MFN (Paragraph 2 of the Context)  
     – If Licensor enters into any agreement (including side letters or informal arrangements) with a third party for VOD distribution in the U.S. or the Territory on terms more favourable than those in this Agreement (e.g., license fees, royalty payments, marketing support), then Rogers may incorporate or substitute those more favourable terms into this Agreement, retroactive to the date those terms were first granted to the third party.  
     – Licensor must also deliver, by February 28 each year, a sworn statement or auditor’s certificate confirming whether any such more-favourable agreements were entered into, and if so, identifying the effective date and the specific terms (Context, second paragraph).

These provisions together constitute an MFN regime protecting Rogers as to both timing and economic terms.","cuad/EuromediaHoldingsCorp_20070215_10SB12G_EX-10.B(01)_525118_EX-10.B(01)_Content License Agreement.txt"
"Consider the Video-on-Demand Content License Agreement between Rogers Cable Communications Inc. and EuroMedia Holdings Corp.; Can this contract be terminated for convenience, and under what conditions?","Based solely on the clause you’ve provided:

1. Termination for Convenience  
   - “Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Rogers may terminate this Agreement, at any time, upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to Licensor.”  
   - This language establishes that Rogers has an unfettered right to terminate the agreement for convenience.

2. Conditions of Termination  
   - Party entitled: Rogers Cable Communications Inc. (“Rogers”).  
   - Notice period: 60 days’ prior written notice.  
   - No further conditions or mutual-termination rights are specified in the provided text.

3. Missing Information  
   - The clause does not address whether EuroMedia Holdings Corp. (the Licensor) may terminate for convenience.  
   - No additional obligations (e.g., payment on early termination) or carve-outs (e.g., ongoing royalty payments) are mentioned here.

Conclusion  
- Rogers may unilaterally terminate this agreement for convenience at any time, provided it gives 60 days’ written notice to Licensor. There is no indication in the provided clause that Licensor has a corresponding right.","cuad/EuromediaHoldingsCorp_20070215_10SB12G_EX-10.B(01)_525118_EX-10.B(01)_Content License Agreement.txt"

   b. A purchaser of all or substantially all of the assets used in connection with the ROD Service.

3. Change‑of‑control clarification  
   – “A change of control of Rogers shall not be considered an assignment of this Agreement.”

4. Invalidity of unauthorized transfers  
   – “Any purported assignment, sale, or transfer in contravention of this Section shall be null and void.”

All of the above appears in the single “Assignment” section of the Agreement.","cuad/EuromediaHoldingsCorp_20070215_10SB12G_EX-10.B(01)_525118_EX-10.B(01)_Content License Agreement.txt"
"Consider the Video-on-Demand Content License Agreement between Rogers Cable Communications Inc. and EuroMedia Holdings Corp.; Does this contract include any revenue or profit-sharing arrangements?","Based solely on the provided excerpts, the Agreement contains revenue‑sharing but no explicit profit‑sharing provisions.  

1. Revenue‑sharing arrangements  
   a. Rogers → Licensor  
      – “Rogers shall pay to Licensor a fee (the ‘License Fee’), which shall be equal to fifty (50)% of Retail Revenues.”  
        • Source: first paragraph.  
   b. Licensor → Rogers  
      – “Licensor agrees to pay to Rogers an amount which shall be equal to ten (10)% of License Fees, calculated on a rolling basis … payable monthly.”  
        • Source: second paragraph.  

2. Cost‑sharing/reimbursements  
   a. Production Fund Commitment  
      – Licensor reimburses Rogers for 50% of Rogers’s statutorily‑required contributions to a Canadian program production fund in respect of Licensed Programs.  
        • Source: third paragraph.  
   b. Copyright Royalties  
      – Licensor reimburses Rogers for 50% of any copyright royalties actually paid by Rogers.  
        • Source: fourth paragraph.  

3. Profit‑sharing  
   – The excerpts do not mention any arrangement based on net profits or profit‑sharing.  

Conclusion:  
• Yes, there are revenue‑sharing mechanisms (50% of Retail Revenues to Licensor; 10% of License Fees back to Rogers) plus 50% cost‑reimbursements for production‑fund contributions and royalties.  
• No profit‑sharing formula is stated in the provided context.","cuad/EuromediaHoldingsCorp_20070215_10SB12G_EX-10.B(01)_525118_EX-10.B(01)_Content License Agreement.txt"
"Consider the Video-on-Demand Content License Agreement between Rogers Cable Communications Inc. and EuroMedia Holdings Corp.; Is there a minimum commitment required under this contract?","Based solely on the “Promotional Program” clause you’ve provided:

1.  Minimum Content Availability by Licensor  
    – Section (Promotional Programs): “Licensor shall make available to Rogers, on a free trial basis and at no cost to Rogers, not less than ten (10) Licensed Programs at all times during the Term….”

2.  No Minimum Commitment by Rogers Stated  
    – The clause imposes a minimum‐content obligation on EuroMedia (the Licensor), not on Rogers.  
    – There is no language in the provided text requiring Rogers to license, purchase or otherwise commit to any minimum number of Program titles or payment.

Conclusion: The contract excerpt sets a minimum availability of ten Promotional Programs (section on Promotional Programs), but it does not establish any minimum commitment requirement on Rogers. If any financial or volume commitments exist elsewhere in the Agreement, they are not included in the provided context.","cuad/EuromediaHoldingsCorp_20070215_10SB12G_EX-10.B(01)_525118_EX-10.B(01)_Content License Agreement.txt"
"Consider the Video-on-Demand Content License Agreement between Rogers Cable Communications Inc. and EuroMedia Holdings Corp.; What licenses are granted under this contract?","The Agreement grants Rogers the following non‑exclusive licenses (see Context ¶¶1–2):  

1. Non‑exclusive VOD Distribution & Exhibition License  
   - Rogers may distribute and exhibit in Canada (“Territory”) all “Licensed Programs” – i.e., the entertainment programming for which Licensor owns or controls VOD distribution/exhibition rights – to residential subscribers of Rogers’ digital cable television service on a Video‑on‑Demand basis. (Context ¶1)  

2. License Period Right  
   - For each Licensed Program, Rogers may make it available on a VOD basis for 90 consecutive days (or a longer period if mutually agreed). (Context ¶2)  

No other licenses are specified in the provided excerpts.","cuad/EuromediaHoldingsCorp_20070215_10SB12G_EX-10.B(01)_525118_EX-10.B(01)_Content License Agreement.txt"
"Consider the Video-on-Demand Content License Agreement between Rogers Cable Communications Inc. and EuroMedia Holdings Corp.; Does this contract include an unlimited or all-you-can-eat license?","Based solely on the single clause you’ve provided, the Agreement does grant what is commonly understood as an “all‑you‑can‑eat” or unlimited‐viewing license—subject only to the defined Viewing Period.  

Key point from the context:  
• “Multiple viewings of the Licensed Program shall be permitted during the Viewing Period for no additional fee and all such viewings shall be considered a single exhibition of the Licensed Program for the purposes of calculating License Fees hereunder.”  

Interpretation:  
1. Unlimited viewings:  The Licensee may view the program any number of times during the Viewing Period.  
2. Single exhibition treatment:  No matter how many times it is viewed, it counts as only one “exhibition” for fee purposes.  
3. No per‑viewing charges:  There is no additional fee tied to repeat viewings within the Viewing Period.  

Conclusion:  
Yes. Within the defined Viewing Period, the contract operates as an unlimited (“all‑you‑can‑eat”) license, since multiple viewings incur no extra fees and are aggregated into a single exhibition for licensing‑fee calculation.  

Note: If you need to know whether there are any other constraints (e.g., device limits, geographic limits, blackout windows), those would have to be confirmed by reviewing additional provisions of the Agreement, which are not included in your excerpt.","cuad/EuromediaHoldingsCorp_20070215_10SB12G_EX-10.B(01)_525118_EX-10.B(01)_Content License Agreement.txt"
"Consider the Video-on-Demand Content License Agreement between Rogers Cable Communications Inc. and EuroMedia Holdings Corp.; What are the audit rights under this contract?","Under the Agreement’s audit-rights provision:  
1. Who may audit:  
   - Rogers Cable Communications Inc. and its authorized representatives.  

2. Scope of the audit:  
   - Inspection and/or audit of EuroMedia Holdings Corp.’s books and records.  
   - Purpose: to confirm compliance with Licensor’s obligations under the contract.  

3. Timing and notice:  
   - Must give EuroMedia reasonable prior written notice.  
   - Audits are to occur only during EuroMedia’s regular business hours.  

4. Duration of right:  
   - During the Term of the Agreement.  
   - For twelve (12) months after the Term expires.  

Citation: “During the Term, and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter, Rogers (and its representatives) shall have the right, upon reasonable prior written notice to Licensor, and during regular business hours, to inspect and/or audit Licensor’s books and records to confirm compliance with Licensor’s obligations under this Section.”","cuad/EuromediaHoldingsCorp_20070215_10SB12G_EX-10.B(01)_525118_EX-10.B(01)_Content License Agreement.txt"
"Consider the Video-on-Demand Content License Agreement between Rogers Cable Communications Inc. and EuroMedia Holdings Corp.; Is there uncapped liability under this contract?","Based solely on the excerpt you’ve provided:

1. Limitation of Liability Clause (as quoted)  
   “Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind.”  

2. Uncapped Liability for IP-Infringement  
   • Because the Limitation of Liability applies “except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right,” liability for third-party IP infringement is not subject to those damage-type limitations.  
   • In other words, any claim or liability based on IP infringement remains fully “uncapped” by this provision.

3. Other Liabilities  
   • All other categories of damages (special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental) are expressly disclaimed and thus capped at zero for each party.  
   • The excerpt does not address whether there is a separate monetary cap on direct damages, nor does it indicate any other exceptions.

4. Insufficiency of Information  
   • No information is provided about a dollar-value cap on direct damages or any broader liability caps.  
   • To determine whether other liabilities (e.g. direct damages) are capped, or whether additional exceptions apply, one would need to review the full Limitation of Liability section and any related provisions.","cuad/EuromediaHoldingsCorp_20070215_10SB12G_EX-10.B(01)_525118_EX-10.B(01)_Content License Agreement.txt"

   “Except with respect to any claim or liability arising from an infringement of any third party intellectual property right, in no event shall either party be liable for any special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental damages of any kind.”

  – The clause removes liability for certain types of damages (special, indirect, consequential, punitive or incidental).  
  – It does not set a maximum dollar amount (“cap”) on the parties’ overall liability.

  – Without seeing the full Agreement (including any other limitation‐of‐liability or indemnification provisions), we cannot determine whether a separate clause imposes a monetary cap elsewhere.","cuad/EuromediaHoldingsCorp_20070215_10SB12G_EX-10.B(01)_525118_EX-10.B(01)_Content License Agreement.txt"

Accordingly, the contract does include an exclusivity provision.","cuad/GopageCorp_20140221_10-K_EX-10.1_8432966_EX-10.1_Content License Agreement.txt"
"Consider the Content License Agreement between PSiTech Corporation and Empirical Ventures, Inc.; What happens in the event of a change of control of one of the parties in this contract?","Based solely on the excerpt you’ve provided, a change of control of the Licensee (Empirical Ventures, Inc.) is treated as follows:

1. Any merger, consolidation or reorganization involving the Licensee—whether it survives the transaction or disappears—is “deemed to be a transfer of rights, obligations or performance under this Agreement.”  
2. Such a “transfer” cannot occur without the Licensor’s (PSiTech Corporation’s) prior written consent.  

Citation: “For purposes of the preceding sentence, and without limiting its generality, any merger, consolidation or reorganization involving Licensee (regardless of whether Licensee is a surviving or disappearing entity) will be deemed to be a transfer of rights, obligations or performance under this Agreement for which Licensor’s prior written consent is required.”  

Note: The provided text addresses only the Licensee’s change of control. No provision concerning a change of control of the Licensor appears in the excerpt you supplied.","cuad/GopageCorp_20140221_10-K_EX-10.1_8432966_EX-10.1_Content License Agreement.txt"

2. “Any purported assignment, delegation or transfer in violation of this Section 11.7 is void from the outset and shall be of no force or effect.”

These provisions prohibit any assignment or delegation by the Licensee without the Licensor’s written approval and render any unauthorized assignment void.","cuad/GopageCorp_20140221_10-K_EX-10.1_8432966_EX-10.1_Content License Agreement.txt"

"Consider the Content License Agreement between PSiTech Corporation and Empirical Ventures, Inc.; Are the licenses granted under this contract non-transferable?","The Licenses granted under the Agreement are, by their own terms, non-transferable except in the specific circumstance described in Section 11.7.  

• Section 1 (License Grant for Content) states that the license is “non-transferable (except as provided in Section 11.7) and non-sublicensable.”  
• Section 1 (License Grant for Marks) likewise describes the license as “non-transferable (except as provided in Section 11.7) and non-sublicensable.”  

Because the only carve-out to non-transferability is found in Section 11.7—and that section’s text is not provided in the supplied context—the general rule is that neither the Content license nor the Marks license may be transferred.","cuad/GopageCorp_20140221_10-K_EX-10.1_8432966_EX-10.1_Content License Agreement.txt"

"Consider the Content License Agreement between PSiTech Corporation and Empirical Ventures, Inc.; Is there uncapped liability under this contract?","Based on the single sentence you’ve provided, the agreement carves out two exceptions to the caps in Sections 9.1 and 9.2, meaning in those two scenarios liability is uncapped:

1. Indemnification under Section 8.2  
   – “The provisions of Section 9.1 and Section 9.2 will not apply to limit the Licensee’s indemnification obligations under Section 8.2.”  
   – Implication: Any indemnity the Licensee owes under § 8.2 is unlimited by the caps otherwise found in § 9.1/9.2.

2. Gross negligence or wilful misconduct  
   – Those same sections (§ 9.1/9.2) “will not apply … in the case of Licensee’s gross negligence or wilful misconduct.”  
   – Implication: The Licensee may be fully liable (without cap) for damages arising from its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.

Limitations of this analysis  
• We have only the excerpt above; there may be other uncapped‑liability provisions or additional caps elsewhere.  
• No conclusion can be drawn about liabilities outside § 8.2 or gross negligence/wilful misconduct.","cuad/GopageCorp_20140221_10-K_EX-10.1_8432966_EX-10.1_Content License Agreement.txt"
"Consider the Content License Agreement between PSiTech Corporation and Empirical Ventures, Inc.; Is there a cap on liability under this contract?","Based on the language you’ve provided, there is indeed a monetary cap on liability.  In particular:

   • (Context, ¶1)

2. Cap on Direct Liability  
   • “Each party’s liability arising out of or related to this Agreement will not exceed an amount equal to the aggregate amounts paid or payable to Licensor in the twelve (12) months preceding the commencement of the claim.”  
   • (Context, ¶2)

In sum, while indirect and consequential damages are fully excluded, any recoverable (i.e., direct) damages are capped at the total fees paid—or payable—to Licensor during the twelve months immediately before the claim arose.","cuad/GopageCorp_20140221_10-K_EX-10.1_8432966_EX-10.1_Content License Agreement.txt"
